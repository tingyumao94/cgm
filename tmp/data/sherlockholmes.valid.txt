field for an acute and <unk> observer , but the other was so strange in its <unk> and so <unk> 
in its details that it may be the more <unk> of being placed upon <unk> , even if it gave 
my friend <unk> <unk> for those <unk> methods of reasoning by which he <unk> such remarkable results . the story 
has , i believe , been told more than once in the <unk> , but , like all such <unk> 
, its <unk> is much less <unk> when <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a single half - <unk> of <unk> 
than when the facts slowly <unk> before your own eyes , and the mystery <unk> <unk> away as each new 
<unk> <unk> a step which <unk> on to the complete <unk> . at the time the circumstances made a deep 
impression upon me , and the <unk> of two years has hardly <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . it was 
in the <unk> of ' <unk> , not long after my marriage , that the <unk> <unk> which i am 
now about to <unk> . i had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned holmes in his baker street 
rooms , <unk> i <unk> <unk> him and occasionally even <unk> him to <unk> his bohemian habits so far as 
to come and visit us . my practice had <unk> increased , and as i <unk> to <unk> at no 
very great <unk> from <unk> station , i got a few <unk> from among the <unk> . one of these 
, whom i had <unk> of a <unk> and <unk> <unk> , was never <unk> of <unk> my <unk> and 
of endeavouring to send me on every <unk> over whom he might have any influence . one morning , at 
a little before seven o ' clock , i was <unk> by the maid <unk> at the door to <unk> 
that two men had come from <unk> and were waiting in the consulting - room . i dressed hurriedly , 
for i knew by <unk> that <unk> cases were seldom <unk> , and <unk> <unk> . as i descended , 
my old <unk> , the <unk> , came out of the room and <unk> the door <unk> behind him . 
" i ' ve got him here ," he whispered , <unk> his thumb over his shoulder ; " he 
' s all right ." " what is it , then ?" i asked , for his manner suggested that 
it was some strange creature which he had <unk> up in my room . " it ' s a new 
patient ," he whispered . " i thought i ' <unk> bring him round myself ; then he <unk> ' 
t <unk> away . there he is , all safe and sound . i must go now , doctor ; 
i have my <unk> , just the same as you ." and off he went , this <unk> <unk> , 
without even <unk> me time to thank him . i entered my consulting - room and found a gentleman <unk> 
by the table . he was quietly dressed in a suit of <unk> tweed with a <unk> <unk> cap which 
he had laid down upon my books . round one of his hands he had a <unk> <unk> , which 
was <unk> all over with <unk> . he was young , not more than five - and - twenty , 
i should say , with a strong , <unk> face ; but he was <unk> <unk> and gave me the 
impression of a man who was <unk> from some strong agitation , which it took all his <unk> of mind 
to <unk> . " i am sorry to <unk> you up so <unk> , doctor ," said he , " 
but i have had a very serious <unk> during the night . i came in by train this morning , 
and on <unk> at <unk> as to where i might find a doctor , a <unk> fellow very kindly <unk> 
me here . i gave the maid a <unk> , but i see that she has left it upon the 
side - table ." i took it up and glanced at it . " mr . <unk> <unk> , <unk> 
engineer , <unk> , <unk> street ( <unk> floor <unk> that was the name , <unk> , and <unk> of 
my morning visitor . " i <unk> that i have <unk> you waiting ," said i , sitting down in 
my <unk> - chair . " you are fresh from a night journey , i understand , which is in 
itself a <unk> <unk> ." " oh , my night could not be called <unk> ," said he , and 
laughed . he laughed very heartily , with a high , ringing note , <unk> back in his chair and 
<unk> his sides . all my medical <unk> rose up against that <unk> . " <unk> it !" i cried 
; " pull yourself together !" and i <unk> out some <unk> from a <unk> . it was <unk> , 
however . he was off in one of those <unk> <unk> which come upon a strong nature when some great 
<unk> is over and gone . presently he came to himself once more , very <unk> and <unk> - looking 
. " i have been making a <unk> of myself ," he <unk> . " not at all . <unk> 
this ." i dashed some <unk> into the <unk> , and the <unk> began to come back to his <unk> 
<unk> . " that ' s better !" said he . " and now , doctor , perhaps you would 
kindly attend to my thumb , or rather to the <unk> where my thumb <unk> to be ." he <unk> 
the <unk> and <unk> out his hand . it gave even my hardened nerves a <unk> to look at it 
. there were four <unk> <unk> and a <unk> red , <unk> <unk> where the thumb should have been . 
it had been <unk> or <unk> right out from the <unk> . " good <unk> !" i cried , " 
this is a <unk> <unk> . it must have <unk> <unk> ." " yes , it did . i <unk> 
when it was done , and i think that i must have been <unk> for a long time . when 
i came to i found that it was still <unk> , so i <unk> one end of my <unk> very 
<unk> round the wrist and <unk> it up with a <unk> ." " excellent ! you should have been a 
<unk> ." " it is a question of <unk> , you see , and came within my own <unk> ." 
" this has been done ," said i , <unk> the <unk> , " by a very heavy and sharp 
instrument ." " a thing like a <unk> ," said he . " an <unk> , i <unk> ?" " 
by no means ." " what ! a <unk> <unk> ?" " very <unk> indeed ." " you <unk> me 
." i <unk> the <unk> , <unk> it , dressed it , and finally <unk> it over with <unk> <unk> 
and <unk> <unk> . he lay back without <unk> , though he bit his lip from time to time . 
" how is that ?" i asked when i had finished . " capital ! between your <unk> and your 
<unk> , i <unk> a new man . i was very <unk> , but i have had a good deal 
to go through ." " perhaps you had better not speak of the matter . it is evidently <unk> to 
your nerves ." " oh , no , not now . i shall have to tell my <unk> to the 
police ; but , between ourselves , if it were not for the <unk> <unk> of this <unk> of mine 
, i should be <unk> if they <unk> my <unk> , for it is a very extraordinary one , and 
i have not much in the way of <unk> with which to back it up ; and , even if 
they believe me , the clues which i can give them are so vague that it is a question whether 
<unk> will be done ." " ha !" cried i , " if it is anything in the nature of 
a problem which you desire to see <unk> , i should strongly <unk> you to come to my friend , 
mr . sherlock holmes , before you go to the official police ." " oh , i have heard of 
that fellow ," answered my visitor , " and i should be very glad if he would take the matter 
up , though of course i must use the official police as well . would you give me an <unk> 
to him ?" " i ' ll do better . i ' ll take you round to him myself ." 
" i should be immensely obliged to you ." " we ' ll call a cab and go together . 
we shall just be in time to have a little <unk> with him . do you <unk> <unk> to it 
?" " yes ; i shall not <unk> easy until i have told my story ." " then my servant 
will call a cab , and i shall be with you in an instant ." i rushed <unk> , explained 
the matter shortly to my wife , and in five minutes was inside a hansom , driving with my new 
acquaintance to baker street . sherlock holmes was , as i expected , lounging about his sitting - room in 
his <unk> - <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> of the times and smoking his before - <unk> <unk> , 
which was <unk> of all the <unk> and <unk> left from his <unk> of the day before , all carefully 
<unk> and <unk> on the corner of the <unk> . he received us in his quietly <unk> fashion , <unk> 
fresh <unk> and <unk> , and joined us in a <unk> <unk> . when it was <unk> he <unk> our 
new acquaintance upon the sofa , placed a <unk> <unk> his head , and laid a glass of <unk> and 
<unk> within his reach . " it is easy to see that your <unk> has been no <unk> one , 
mr . <unk> ," said he . " pray , lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home . 
tell us what you can , but <unk> when you are <unk> and keep up your <unk> with a little 
<unk> ." " thank you ," said my patient , " but i have felt another man since the doctor 
<unk> me , and i think that your <unk> has completed the <unk> . i shall take up as little 
of your <unk> time as <unk> , so i shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences ." holmes sat 
in his <unk> armchair with the <unk> , heavy - <unk> expression which <unk> his keen and <unk> nature , 
while i sat <unk> to him , and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor <unk> 
to us . " you must know ," said he , " that i am an <unk> and a bachelor 
, <unk> alone in lodgings in london . by profession i am a <unk> engineer , and i have had 
<unk> <unk> of my work during the seven years that i was <unk> to <unk> & <unk> , the well 
- known <unk> , of <unk> . two years ago , having <unk> my time , and having also come 
into a <unk> <unk> of money through my poor <unk> ' s death , i determined to start in business 
for myself and took <unk> chambers in <unk> street . " i suppose that everyone finds his first <unk> start 
in business a <unk> <unk> . to me it has been <unk> so . during two years i have had 
three <unk> and one small <unk> , and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought me . my 
gross <unk> <unk> to <unk> pounds <unk> . every day , from <unk> in the morning until four in the 
afternoon , i waited in my little <unk> , until at last my heart began to <unk> , and i 
came to believe that i should never have any practice at all . " yesterday , however , just as 
i was <unk> of <unk> the <unk> , my <unk> entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished 
to see me upon business . he brought up a <unk> , too , with the name of ' <unk> 
<unk> <unk> ' <unk> upon it . close at his heels came the <unk> himself , a man rather over 
the <unk> size , but of an <unk> <unk> . i do not think that i have ever seen so 
<unk> a man . his whole face <unk> away into <unk> and chin , and the <unk> of his <unk> 
was drawn quite <unk> over his <unk> <unk> . yet this <unk> seemed to be his <unk> habit , and 
<unk> to no <unk> , for his eye was <unk> , his step <unk> , and his <unk> <unk> . 
he was plainly but <unk> dressed , and his <unk> , i should <unk> , would be <unk> <unk> than 
thirty . "' mr . <unk> ?' said he , with something of a german accent . ' you have 
been <unk> to me , mr . <unk> , as being a man who is not only <unk> in his 
profession but is also <unk> and capable of <unk> a secret .' " i <unk> , <unk> as <unk> as 
any young man would at such an address . ' may i <unk> who it was who gave me so 
good a character ?' "' well , perhaps it is better that i should not tell you that just at 
this moment . i have it from the same <unk> that you are both an <unk> and a bachelor and 
are <unk> alone in london .' "' that is quite <unk> ,' i answered ; ' but you will excuse 
me if i say that i <unk> see how all this <unk> upon my <unk> <unk> . i understand that 
it was on a <unk> matter that you wished to speak to me ?' "' <unk> so . but you 
will find that all i say is really to the point . i have a <unk> <unk> for you , 
but absolute secrecy is quite <unk> -- absolute secrecy , you understand , and of course we may <unk> that 
more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the <unk> of his family .' "' 
if i promise to keep a secret ,' said i , ' you may absolutely <unk> upon my doing so 
.' " he looked very hard at me as i spoke , and it seemed to me that i had 
never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye . "' do you promise , then ?' said he at last 
. "' yes , i promise .' "' absolute and complete silence before , during , and after ? no 
<unk> to the matter at all , either in word or writing ?' "' i have already given you my 
word .' "' very good .' he suddenly sprang up , and <unk> like <unk> across the room he <unk> 
open the door . the passage outside was empty . "' that ' s all right ,' said he , 
coming back . ' i know that <unk> are <unk> <unk> as to their master ' s affairs . now 
we can <unk> in <unk> .' he drew up his chair very close to mine and began to <unk> at 
me again with the same questioning and <unk> look . " a <unk> of <unk> , and of something akin 
to fear had <unk> to rise within me at the strange <unk> of this <unk> man . even my <unk> 
of <unk> a client could not <unk> me from showing my impatience . "' i <unk> that you will state 
your business , sir ,' said i ; ' my time is of <unk> .' <unk> <unk> me for that 
last sentence , but the <unk> came to my <unk> . "' how would fifty guineas for a night ' 
s work suit you ?' he asked . "' most admirably .' "' i say a night ' s work 
, but an hour ' s would be <unk> the mark . i <unk> want your <unk> about a <unk> 
<unk> machine which has got out of <unk> . if you show us what is <unk> we shall soon <unk> 
it right ourselves . what do you think of such a <unk> as that ?' "' the work appears to 
be light and the pay <unk> .' "' precisely so . we shall want you to come to - night 
by the last train .' "' where to ?' "' to <unk> , in <unk> . it is a little 
<unk> near the <unk> of <unk> , and within seven <unk> of <unk> . there is a train from <unk> 
which would bring you there at about <unk> : 15 .' "' very good .' "' i shall come down 
in a carriage to meet you .' "' there is a drive , then ?' "' yes , our little 
<unk> is quite out in the country . it is a good seven <unk> from <unk> station .' "' then 
we can hardly get there before midnight . i suppose there would be no chance of a train back . 
i should be compelled to <unk> the night .' "' yes , we could easily give you a shake - 
down .' "' that is very <unk> . could i not come at some more <unk> hour ?' "' we 
have <unk> it best that you should come late . it is to <unk> you for any <unk> that we 
are <unk> to you , a young and unknown man , a <unk> which would <unk> an <unk> from the 
very heads of your profession . still , of course , if you would like to draw out of the 
business , there is <unk> of time to do so .' " i thought of the fifty guineas , and 
of how very <unk> they would be to me . ' not at all ,' said i , ' i 
shall be very <unk> to <unk> myself to your wishes . i should like , however , to understand a 
little more <unk> what it is that you wish me to do .' "' quite so . it is very 
<unk> that the <unk> of secrecy which we have <unk> from you should have <unk> your curiosity . i have 
no wish to <unk> you to anything without your having it all laid before you . i suppose that we 
are absolutely safe from <unk> ?' "' entirely .' "' then the matter stands <unk> . you are probably aware 
that <unk> ' s - <unk> is a <unk> <unk> , and that it is only found in one or 
two <unk> in england ?' "' i have heard so .' "' some little time ago i bought a small 
<unk> -- a very small <unk> -- within ten <unk> of <unk> . i was fortunate enough to discover that 
there was a <unk> of <unk> ' s - <unk> in one of my <unk> . on <unk> it , 
however , i found that this <unk> was a <unk> small one , and that it <unk> a <unk> between 
two very much <unk> <unk> upon the right and left -- both of them , however , in the <unk> 
of my <unk> . these good people were absolutely <unk> that their <unk> <unk> that which was quite as <unk> 
as a gold - mine . naturally , it was to my interest to <unk> their <unk> before they <unk> 
its true <unk> , but <unk> i had no capital by which i could do this . i took a 
few of my <unk> into the secret , however , and they suggested that we should quietly and <unk> work 
our own little <unk> and that in this way we should <unk> the money which would <unk> us to <unk> 
the <unk> <unk> . this we have now been doing for some time , and in order to help us 
in our <unk> we <unk> a <unk> press . this press , as i have already explained , has got 
out of order , and we wish your <unk> upon the subject . we <unk> our secret very <unk> , 
however , and if it once became known that we had <unk> <unk> coming to our little house , it 
would soon <unk> inquiry , and then , if the facts came out , it would be good - <unk> 
to any chance of getting these <unk> and <unk> out our plans . that is why i have made you 
promise me that you will not tell a <unk> being that you are <unk> to <unk> to - night . 
i hope that i make it all <unk> ?' "' i quite follow you ,' said i . ' the 
only point which i could not quite understand was what use you could make of a <unk> press in <unk> 
<unk> ' s - <unk> , which , as i understand , is <unk> out like <unk> from a <unk> 
.' "' ah !' said he carelessly , ' we have our own process . we <unk> the <unk> into 
<unk> , so as to remove them without <unk> what they are . but that is a <unk> <unk> . 
i have taken you <unk> into my <unk> now , mr . <unk> , and i have shown you how 
i trust you .' he rose as he spoke . ' i shall <unk> you , then , at <unk> 
at <unk> : 15 .' "' i shall certainly be there .' "' and not a word to a soul 
.' he looked at me with a last long , questioning gaze , and then , <unk> my hand in 
a cold , <unk> grasp , he hurried from the room . " well , when i came to think 
it all over in <unk> blood i was very much <unk> , as you may both think , at this 
<unk> <unk> which had been intrusted to me . on the one hand , of course , i was glad 
, for the <unk> was at least <unk> what i should have asked had i <unk> a <unk> upon my 
own services , and it was <unk> that this order might lead to other <unk> . on the other hand 
, the face and manner of my <unk> had made an <unk> impression upon me , and i could not 
think that his <unk> of the <unk> ' s - <unk> was sufficient to explain the <unk> for my coming 
at midnight , and his extreme anxiety <unk> i should tell anyone of my <unk> . however , i threw 
all <unk> to the <unk> , <unk> a <unk> <unk> , drove to <unk> , and started off , having 
<unk> to the letter the <unk> as to <unk> my <unk> . " at <unk> i had to change not 
only my carriage but my station . however , i was in time for the last train to <unk> , 
and i reached the little <unk> - lit station after <unk> o ' clock . i was the only <unk> 
who got out there , and there was no one upon the <unk> save a single <unk> <unk> with a 
<unk> . as i passed out through the <unk> <unk> , however , i found my acquaintance of the morning 
waiting in the shadow upon the other side . without a word he <unk> my arm and hurried me into 
a carriage , the door of which was standing open . he drew up the windows on either side , 
<unk> on the wood - work , and away we went as fast as the <unk> could go ." " 
one <unk> ?" <unk> holmes . " yes , only one ." " did you observe the <unk> ?" " 
yes , i saw it by the side - lights when i was <unk> into the carriage . it was 
a <unk> ." " <unk> - looking or fresh ?" " oh , fresh and <unk> ." " thank you 
. i am sorry to have <unk> you . pray continue your most interesting <unk> ." " away we went 
then , and we drove for at least an hour . <unk> <unk> <unk> had said that it was only 
seven <unk> , but i should think , from the <unk> that we seemed to go , and from the 
time that we took , that it must have been <unk> twelve . he sat at my side in silence 
all the time , and i was aware , more than once when i glanced in his direction , that 
he was looking at me with great <unk> . the country <unk> <unk> to be not very good in that 
part of the world , for we <unk> and <unk> <unk> . i tried to look out of the windows 
to see something of where we were , but they were made of <unk> glass , and i could make 
out nothing save the <unk> <unk> <unk> of a passing light . now and then i <unk> some <unk> to 
<unk> the <unk> of the journey , but the <unk> answered only in <unk> , and the <unk> soon <unk> 
. at last , however , the <unk> of the road was <unk> for the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> 
- drive , and the carriage came to a <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> sprang out , and , as 
i followed after him , pulled me swiftly into a <unk> which <unk> in front of us . we stepped 
, as it were , right out of the carriage and into the hall , so that i failed to 
catch the most <unk> glance of the front of the house . the instant that i had <unk> the <unk> 
the door <unk> <unk> behind us , and i heard <unk> the <unk> of the wheels as the carriage drove 
away . " it was <unk> dark inside the house , and the <unk> <unk> about looking for <unk> and 
<unk> under his <unk> . suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage , and a long 
, <unk> <unk> of light shot out in our direction . it <unk> <unk> , and a woman appeared with 
a <unk> in her hand , which she <unk> above her head , <unk> her face forward and peering at 
us . i could see that she was pretty , and from the <unk> with which the light <unk> upon 
her dark dress i knew that it was a rich <unk> . she spoke a few <unk> in a <unk> 
<unk> in a <unk> as though <unk> a question , and when my companion answered in a <unk> <unk> she 
gave such a start that the <unk> nearly fell from her hand . <unk> <unk> went up to her , 
whispered something in her ear , and then , <unk> her back into the room from whence she had come 
, he walked towards me again with the <unk> in his hand . "' perhaps you will have the <unk> 
to wait in this room for a few minutes ,' said he , throwing open another door . it was 
a quiet , little , plainly furnished room , with a round table in the centre , on which several 
german books were scattered . <unk> <unk> laid down the <unk> on the top of a <unk> beside the door 
. ' i shall not keep you waiting an instant ,' said he , and vanished into the <unk> . 
" i glanced at the books upon the table , and in <unk> of my <unk> of german i could 
see that two of them were <unk> on science , the others being <unk> of <unk> . then i walked 
across to the window , <unk> that i might catch some glimpse of the country - side , but an 
<unk> shutter , <unk> <unk> , was <unk> across it . it was a <unk> <unk> house . there was 
an old clock <unk> <unk> <unk> in the passage , but <unk> <unk> was <unk> still . a vague <unk> 
of <unk> began to <unk> over me . who were these german people , and what were they doing living 
in this strange , out - of - the - way <unk> ? and where was the <unk> ? i 
was ten <unk> or so from <unk> , that was all i knew , but whether <unk> , <unk> , 
<unk> , or <unk> i had no <unk> . for that matter , <unk> , and <unk> other large <unk> 
, were within that <unk> , so the <unk> might not be so <unk> , after all . yet it 
was quite certain , from the absolute <unk> , that we were in the country . i paced up and 
down the room , <unk> a <unk> under my <unk> to keep up my <unk> and <unk> that i was 
thoroughly earning my fifty - guinea <unk> . " suddenly , without any <unk> sound in the <unk> of the 
<unk> <unk> , the door of my room <unk> slowly open . the woman was standing in the <unk> , 
the <unk> of the hall behind her , the <unk> light from my <unk> <unk> upon her <unk> and beautiful 
face . i could see at a glance that she was <unk> with fear , and the <unk> sent a 
<unk> to my own heart . she <unk> up one <unk> <unk> to <unk> me to be <unk> , and 
she shot a few whispered <unk> of broken english at me , her eyes glancing back , like those of 
a <unk> <unk> , into the <unk> behind her . "' i would go ,' said she , <unk> hard 
, as it seemed to me , to speak <unk> ; ' i would go . i should not stay 
here . there is no good for you to do .' "' but , <unk> ,' said i , ' 
i have not yet done what i came for . i <unk> <unk> leave until i have seen the machine 
.' "' it is not <unk> your while to wait ,' she went on . ' you can pass through 
the door ; no one <unk> .' and then , <unk> that i <unk> and <unk> my head , she 
suddenly threw <unk> her <unk> and made a step forward , with her hands <unk> together . ' for the 
love of <unk> !' she whispered , ' get away from here before it is too late !' " but 
i am <unk> <unk> by nature , and the more <unk> to <unk> in an <unk> when there is some 
<unk> in the way . i thought of my fifty - guinea <unk> , of my <unk> journey , and 
of the <unk> night which seemed to be before me . was it all to go for nothing ? why 
should i <unk> away without having carried out my <unk> , and without the <unk> which was my <unk> ? 
this woman might , for all i knew , be a <unk> . with a <unk> <unk> , therefore , 
though her manner had <unk> me more than i <unk> to confess , i still <unk> my head and <unk> 
my intention of <unk> where i was . she was about to <unk> her <unk> when a door <unk> <unk> 
, and the sound of several <unk> was heard upon the stairs . she listened for an instant , threw 
up her hands with a <unk> gesture , and vanished as suddenly and as <unk> as she had come . 
" the <unk> were <unk> <unk> <unk> and a <unk> thick man with a <unk> <unk> <unk> out of the 
<unk> of his double chin , who was <unk> to me as mr . <unk> . "' this is my 
<unk> and <unk> ,' said the <unk> . ' by the way , i was under the impression that i 
left this door <unk> just now . i fear that you have felt the <unk> .' "' on the contrary 
,' said i , ' i opened the door myself because i felt the room to be a little close 
.' " he shot one of his suspicious <unk> at me . ' perhaps we had better <unk> to business 
, then ,' said he . ' mr . <unk> and i will take you up to see the machine 
.' "' i had better put my hat on , i suppose .' "' oh , no , it is 
in the house .' "' what , you <unk> <unk> ' s - <unk> in the house ?' "' no 
, no . this is only where we <unk> it . but never mind that . all we wish you 
to do is to <unk> the machine and to let us know what is <unk> with it .' " we 
went <unk> together , the <unk> first with the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> and i behind him . it 
was a <unk> of an old house , with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> , and little <unk> 
<unk> , the <unk> of which were <unk> out by the <unk> who had <unk> them . there were no 
<unk> and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor , while the <unk> was <unk> off the <unk> 
, and the <unk> was breaking through in <unk> , <unk> <unk> . i tried to put on as <unk> 
an air as <unk> , but i had not <unk> the <unk> of the lady , even though i <unk> 
them , and i <unk> a keen eye upon my two <unk> . <unk> appeared to be a <unk> and 
<unk> man , but i could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow 
- <unk> . " <unk> <unk> <unk> stopped at last before a <unk> door , which he <unk> . within 
was a small , <unk> room , in which the three of us could hardly get at one time . 
<unk> remained outside , and the <unk> <unk> me in . "' we are now ,' said he , ' 
<unk> within the <unk> press , and it would be a particularly <unk> thing for us if anyone were to 
turn it on . the <unk> of this small chamber is really the end of the <unk> <unk> , and 
it comes down with the <unk> of many <unk> upon this <unk> floor . there are small <unk> <unk> of 
<unk> outside which <unk> the <unk> , and which <unk> and <unk> it in the manner which is familiar to 
you . the machine goes <unk> enough , but there is some <unk> in the <unk> of it , and 
it has lost a little of its <unk> . perhaps you will have the <unk> to look it over and 
to show us how we can <unk> it right .' " i took the <unk> from him , and i 
examined the machine very thoroughly . it was indeed a gigantic one , and capable of <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
when i passed outside , however , and <unk> down the <unk> which <unk> it , i knew at once 
by the <unk> sound that there was a <unk> <unk> , which <unk> a <unk> of <unk> through one of 
the side <unk> . an <unk> showed that one of the <unk> - <unk> bands which was round the head 
of a driving - <unk> had <unk> so as not quite to <unk> the <unk> <unk> which it <unk> . 
this was <unk> the cause of the <unk> of power , and i <unk> it out to my <unk> , 
who followed my <unk> very carefully and asked several <unk> <unk> as to how they should <unk> to <unk> it 
right . when i had made it clear to them , i returned to the <unk> chamber of the machine 
and took a good look at it to <unk> my own curiosity . it was <unk> at a glance that 
the story of the <unk> ' s - <unk> was the <unk> <unk> , for it would be <unk> to 
suppose that so <unk> an <unk> could be <unk> for so <unk> a purpose . the <unk> were of wood 
, but the floor consisted of a large <unk> <unk> , and when i came to <unk> it i could 
see a <unk> of <unk> <unk> all over it . i had <unk> and was <unk> at this to see 
exactly what it was when i heard a <unk> <unk> in german and saw the <unk> face of the <unk> 
looking down at me . "' what are you doing there ?' he asked . " i felt <unk> at 
having been <unk> by so <unk> a story as that which he had told me . ' i was <unk> 
your <unk> ' s - <unk> ,' said i ; ' i think that i should be better able to 
advise you as to your machine if i knew what the <unk> purpose was for which it was <unk> .' 
" the instant that i <unk> the <unk> i <unk> the <unk> of my <unk> . his face <unk> hard 
, and a <unk> light sprang up in his <unk> eyes . "' very well ,' said he , ' 
you shall know all about the machine .' he took a step <unk> , <unk> the little door , and 
turned the key in the lock . i rushed towards it and pulled at the <unk> , but it was 
quite secure , and did not give in the least to my <unk> and <unk> . ' <unk> !' i 
<unk> . ' <unk> ! <unk> ! let me out !' " and then suddenly in the silence i heard 
a sound which sent my heart into my mouth . it was the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> 
of the <unk> <unk> . he had <unk> the <unk> at work . the <unk> still stood upon the floor 
where i had placed it when <unk> the <unk> . by its light i saw that the black <unk> was 
coming down upon me , slowly , <unk> , but , as none knew better than myself , with a 
<unk> which must within a <unk> <unk> me to a <unk> <unk> . i threw myself , <unk> , against 
the door , and dragged with my <unk> at the lock . i <unk> the <unk> to let me out 
, but the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> my <unk> . the <unk> was only a <unk> or two 
above my head , and with my hand <unk> i could <unk> its hard , rough <unk> . then it 
<unk> through my mind that the <unk> of my death would <unk> very much upon the position in which i 
<unk> it . if i lay on my face the weight would come upon my <unk> , and i <unk> 
to think of that dreadful <unk> . <unk> the other way , perhaps ; and yet , had i the 
<unk> to lie and look up at that <unk> black shadow <unk> down upon me ? already i was <unk> 
to <unk> <unk> , when my eye caught something which brought a <unk> of hope back to my heart . 
" i have said that though the floor and <unk> were of <unk> , the <unk> were of wood . 
as i gave a last hurried glance around , i saw a <unk> line of <unk> light between two of 
the <unk> , which <unk> and <unk> as a small panel was pushed <unk> . for an instant i could 
hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death . the next instant i threw myself 
through , and lay half - <unk> upon the other side . the panel had <unk> again behind me , 
but the <unk> of the <unk> , and a few <unk> afterwards the <unk> of the two <unk> of <unk> 
, told me how <unk> had been my <unk> . " i was <unk> to myself by a <unk> <unk> 
at my wrist , and i found myself lying upon the <unk> floor of a <unk> <unk> , while a 
woman <unk> over me and <unk> at me with her left hand , while she <unk> a <unk> in her 
right . it was the same good friend whose <unk> i had so <unk> <unk> . "' come ! come 
!' she cried <unk> . ' they will be here in a moment . they will see that you are 
not there . oh , do not <unk> the so - precious time , but come !' " this time 
, at least , i did not <unk> her <unk> . i staggered to my feet and ran with her 
<unk> the <unk> and down a <unk> <unk> . the latter led to another broad passage , and just as 
we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices , one <unk> the 
other from the floor on which we were and from the one <unk> . my <unk> stopped and looked about 
her like one who is at her <unk> ' s end . then she threw open a door which led 
into a bedroom , through the window of which the <unk> was <unk> <unk> . "' it is your only 
chance ,' said she . ' it is high , but it may be that you can <unk> it .' 
" as she spoke a light sprang into view at the <unk> end of the passage , and i saw 
the <unk> figure of <unk> <unk> <unk> rushing forward with a <unk> in one hand and a weapon like a 
<unk> ' s <unk> in the other . i rushed across the bedroom , <unk> open the window , and 
looked out . how quiet and <unk> and <unk> the garden looked in the <unk> , and it could not 
be more than thirty feet down . i <unk> out upon the <unk> , but i hesitated to <unk> until 
i should have heard what passed between my <unk> and the <unk> who pursued me . if she were ill 
- <unk> , then at any <unk> i was determined to go back to her <unk> . the thought had 
hardly <unk> through my mind before he was at the door , <unk> his way past her ; but she 
threw her arms round him and tried to hold him back . "' <unk> ! <unk> !' she cried in 
english , ' remember your promise after the last time . you said it should not be again . he 
will be <unk> ! oh , he will be <unk> !' "' you are mad , <unk> !' he shouted 
, struggling to <unk> away from her . ' you will be the ruin of us . he has seen 
too much . let me pass , i say !' he dashed her to one side , and , rushing 
to the window , <unk> at me with his heavy weapon . i had let myself go , and was 
hanging by the hands to the <unk> , when his blow fell . i was <unk> of a dull <unk> 
, my <unk> <unk> , and i fell into the garden <unk> . " i was <unk> but not hurt 
by the fall ; so i <unk> myself up and rushed off among the <unk> as hard as i could 
run , for i <unk> that i was far from being out of <unk> yet . suddenly , however , 
as i ran , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> came over me . i glanced down at my hand , 
which was <unk> <unk> , and then , for the first time , saw that my thumb had been <unk> 
off and that the blood was <unk> from my <unk> . i <unk> to tie my <unk> round it , 
but there came a <unk> <unk> in my <unk> , and next moment i fell in a dead <unk> among 
the rose - <unk> . " how long i remained <unk> i <unk> tell . it must have been a 
very long time , for the <unk> had sunk , and a <unk> morning was breaking when i came to 
myself . my clothes were all <unk> with <unk> , and my coat - <unk> was <unk> with blood from 
my <unk> thumb . the <unk> of it <unk> in an instant all the <unk> of my night ' s 
adventure , and i sprang to my feet with the <unk> that i might hardly yet be safe from my 
<unk> . but to my <unk> , when i came to look round me , neither house nor garden were 
to be seen . i had been lying in an <unk> of the <unk> close by the <unk> , and 
just a little lower down was a long <unk> , which <unk> , upon my <unk> it , to be 
the very station at which i had arrived upon the <unk> night . were it not for the <unk> <unk> 
upon my hand , all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil <unk> . " 
half <unk> , i went into the station and asked about the morning train . there would be one to 
<unk> in less than an hour . the same <unk> was on <unk> , i found , as had been 
there when i arrived . i <unk> of him whether he had ever heard of <unk> <unk> <unk> . the 
name was strange to him . had he observed a carriage the night before waiting for me ? no , 
he had not . was there a police - station anywhere near ? there was one about three <unk> off 
. " it was too far for me to go , <unk> and ill as i was . i determined 
to wait until i got back to <unk> before <unk> my story to the police . it was a little 
past six when i arrived , so i went first to have my <unk> dressed , and then the doctor 
was kind enough to bring me <unk> here . i put the case into your hands and shall do exactly 
what you advise ." we both sat in silence for some little time after <unk> to this extraordinary <unk> . 
then sherlock holmes pulled down from the <unk> one of the <unk> <unk> books in which he placed his <unk> 
. " here is an <unk> which will interest you ," said he . " it appeared in all the 
papers about a year ago . listen to this : ' lost , on the <unk> <unk> <unk> mr . 
<unk> <unk> , <unk> twenty - six , a <unk> engineer . left his lodgings at ten o ' clock 
at night , and has not been heard of since . was dressed in ,' <unk> <unk> <unk> . ha 
! that <unk> the last time that the <unk> <unk> to have his machine <unk> , i fancy ." " 
good <unk> !" cried my patient . " then that <unk> what the girl said ." " <unk> . it 
is quite clear that the <unk> was a <unk> and <unk> man , who was absolutely determined that nothing should 
<unk> in the way of his little <unk> , like those out - and - out <unk> who will leave 
no <unk> from a <unk> <unk> . well , every moment now is precious , so if you <unk> <unk> 
to it we shall go down to <unk> <unk> at once as a <unk> to <unk> for <unk> ." some 
three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together , bound from <unk> to the little <unk> 
<unk> . there were sherlock holmes , the <unk> engineer , <unk> <unk> , of <unk> <unk> , a <unk> 
- clothes man , and myself . <unk> had <unk> an <unk> <unk> of the <unk> out upon the seat 
and was busy with his <unk> drawing a <unk> with <unk> for its centre . " there you are ," 
said he . " that <unk> is drawn at a <unk> of ten <unk> from the <unk> . the <unk> 
we want must be <unk> near that line . you said ten <unk> , i think , sir ." " 
it was an hour ' s good drive ." " and you think that they brought you back all that 
way when you were <unk> ?" " they must have done so . i have a <unk> memory , too 
, of having been <unk> and conveyed <unk> ." " what i <unk> understand ," said i , " is 
why they should have <unk> you when they found you lying <unk> in the garden . perhaps the <unk> was 
<unk> by the woman ' s <unk> ." " i hardly think that likely . i never saw a more 
<unk> face in my life ." " oh , we shall soon clear up all that ," said <unk> . 
" well , i have drawn my <unk> , and i only wish i knew at what point upon it 
the <unk> that we are in search of are to be found ." " i think i could lay my 
<unk> on it ," said holmes quietly . " really , now !" cried the <unk> , " you have 
<unk> your <unk> ! come , now , we shall see who <unk> with you . i say it is 
<unk> , for the country is more <unk> there ." " and i say <unk> ," said my patient . 
" i am for <unk> ," remarked the <unk> - clothes man . " there are several quiet little <unk> 
up there ." " and i am for <unk> ," said i , " because there are no <unk> there 
, and our friend <unk> that he did not notice the carriage go up any ." " come ," cried 
the <unk> , laughing ; " it ' s a very pretty <unk> of <unk> . we have <unk> the 
<unk> among us . who do you give your <unk> <unk> to ?" " you are all <unk> ." " 
but we can ' t all be ." " oh , yes , you can . this is my point 
." he placed his <unk> in the centre of the <unk> . " this is where we shall find them 
." " but the twelve - <unk> drive ?" <unk> <unk> . " six out and six back . nothing 
<unk> . you say yourself that the <unk> was fresh and <unk> when you got in . how could it 
be that if it had gone twelve <unk> over heavy <unk> ?" " indeed , it is a likely <unk> 
enough ," observed <unk> <unk> . " of course there can be no doubt as to the nature of this 
gang ." " none at all ," said holmes . " they are <unk> on a large <unk> , and 
have <unk> the machine to form the <unk> which has taken the <unk> of silver ." " we have known 
for some time that a <unk> gang was at work ," said the <unk> . " they have been <unk> 
out half - <unk> by the <unk> . we even <unk> them as far as <unk> , but could get 
no <unk> , for they had <unk> their <unk> in a way that showed that they were very old hands 
. but now , <unk> to this lucky chance , i think that we have got them right enough ." 
but the <unk> was mistaken , for those <unk> were not <unk> to fall into the hands of <unk> . 
as we rolled into <unk> station we saw a gigantic <unk> of smoke which <unk> up from behind a small 
<unk> of <unk> in the neighbourhood and <unk> like an immense <unk> <unk> over the <unk> . " a house 
on fire ?" asked <unk> as the train <unk> off again on its way . " yes , sir !" 
said the station - master . " when did it <unk> out ?" " i hear that it was during 
the night , sir , but it has got <unk> , and the whole <unk> is in a <unk> ." 
" whose house is it ?" " dr . <unk> ' s ." " tell me ," broke in the 
engineer , " is dr . <unk> a german , very <unk> , with a long , sharp <unk> ?" 
the station - master laughed heartily . " no , sir , dr . <unk> is an <unk> , and 
there <unk> ' t a man in the <unk> who has a better - lined <unk> . but he has 
a gentleman <unk> with him , a patient , as i understand , who is a <unk> , and he 
<unk> as if a little good <unk> beef would do him no <unk> ." the station - master had not 
finished his <unk> before we were all <unk> in the direction of the fire . the road <unk> a <unk> 
<unk> , and there was a great <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of us , <unk> fire at every <unk> 
and window , while in the garden in front three fire - <unk> were <unk> <unk> to keep the <unk> 
under . " that ' s it !" cried <unk> , in <unk> <unk> . " there is the <unk> 
- drive , and there are the rose - <unk> where i lay . that second window is the one 
that i jumped from ." " well , at least ," said holmes , " you have had your <unk> 
upon them . there can be no question that it was your <unk> - <unk> which , when it was 
<unk> in the press , <unk> fire to the <unk> <unk> , though no doubt they were too <unk> in 
the <unk> after you to observe it at the time . now keep your eyes open in this crowd for 
your <unk> of last night , though i very much fear that they are a good hundred <unk> off by 
now ." and holmes ' <unk> came to be <unk> , for from that day to this no word has 
ever been heard either of the beautiful woman , the <unk> german , or the <unk> <unk> . <unk> that 
morning a <unk> had <unk> a <unk> <unk> several people and some very <unk> <unk> driving <unk> in the direction 
of <unk> , but there all <unk> of the <unk> disappeared , and even holmes ' <unk> failed ever to 
discover the least <unk> as to their <unk> . the <unk> had been much <unk> at the strange arrangements which 
they had found within , and still more so by <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> thumb upon a window - 
<unk> of the second floor . about <unk> , however , their <unk> were at last successful , and they 
<unk> the <unk> , but not before the <unk> had <unk> in , and the whole <unk> been <unk> to 
such absolute ruin that , save some twisted <unk> and <unk> <unk> , not a <unk> remained of the <unk> 
which had cost our <unk> acquaintance so <unk> . large <unk> of <unk> and of <unk> were <unk> <unk> in 
an out - house , but no <unk> were to be found , which may have explained the <unk> of 
those <unk> <unk> which have been already <unk> to . how our <unk> engineer had been conveyed from the garden 
to the <unk> where he recovered his <unk> might have remained <unk> a mystery were it not for the <unk> 
<unk> , which told us a very <unk> <unk> . he had evidently been carried down by two <unk> , 
one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other <unk> large <unk> . on the whole , it was 
most probable that the <unk> <unk> , being less <unk> or less <unk> than his companion , had <unk> the 
woman to bear the <unk> man out of the way of <unk> . " well ," said our engineer <unk> 
as we took our <unk> to return once more to london , " it has been a pretty business for 
me ! i have lost my thumb and i have lost a fifty - guinea <unk> , and what have 
i <unk> ?" " <unk> ," said holmes , laughing . " <unk> it may be of <unk> , you 
know ; you have only to put it into <unk> to <unk> the <unk> of being excellent company for the 
<unk> of your <unk> ." x . the adventure of the noble bachelor the <unk> st . <unk> marriage , 
and its <unk> <unk> , have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted <unk> in which 
the <unk> bridegroom <unk> . fresh <unk> have <unk> it , and their more <unk> details have drawn the <unk> 
away from this four - year - old <unk> . as i have reason to believe , however , that 
the <unk> facts have never been <unk> to the general <unk> , and as my friend sherlock holmes had a 
<unk> <unk> in clearing the matter up , i <unk> that no <unk> of him would be complete without some 
little <unk> of this remarkable <unk> . it was a few <unk> before my own marriage , during the days 
when i was still <unk> rooms with holmes in baker street , that he came home from an afternoon <unk> 
to find a letter on the table waiting for him . i had remained <unk> all day , for the 
weather had taken a <unk> turn to <unk> , with high <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> which i 
had brought back in one of my limbs as a <unk> of my <unk> campaign <unk> with dull <unk> . 
with my <unk> in one easy - chair and my legs upon another , i had surrounded myself with a 
cloud of <unk> until at last , <unk> with the news of the day , i tossed them all <unk> 
and lay <unk> , watching the <unk> <unk> and monogram upon the <unk> upon the table and wondering <unk> who 
my friend ' s noble <unk> could be . " here is a very <unk> epistle ," i remarked as 
he entered . " your morning letters , if i remember right , were from a <unk> - <unk> and 
a <unk> - <unk> ." " yes , my <unk> has certainly the <unk> of <unk> ," he answered , 
<unk> , " and the <unk> are <unk> the more interesting . this <unk> like one of those <unk> <unk> 
<unk> which call upon a man either to be <unk> or to lie ." he broke the seal and glanced 
over the <unk> . " oh , come , it may prove to be something of interest , after all 
." " not <unk> , then ?" " no , <unk> <unk> ." " and from a noble client ?" 
" one of the <unk> in england ." " my dear fellow , i <unk> you ." " i <unk> 
you , watson , without <unk> , that the <unk> of my client is a matter of less moment to 
me than the interest of his case . it is just <unk> , however , that that also may not 
be <unk> in this new investigation . you have been <unk> the papers <unk> of late , have you not 
?" " it <unk> like it ," said i <unk> , <unk> to a <unk> <unk> in the corner . 
" i have had nothing else to do ." " it is fortunate , for you will perhaps be able 
to post me up . i read nothing except the <unk> news and the <unk> <unk> . the latter is 
always <unk> . but if you have followed recent <unk> so closely you must have read about <unk> st . 
<unk> and his <unk> ?" " oh , yes , with the deepest interest ." " that is well . 
the letter which i hold in my hand is from <unk> st . <unk> . i will read it to 
you , and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever <unk> upon the matter 
. this is what he <unk> : "' my dear mr . sherlock holmes <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> me that 
i may <unk> <unk> <unk> upon your <unk> and discretion . i have determined , therefore , to call upon 
you and to consult you in <unk> to the very <unk> <unk> which has <unk> in <unk> with my <unk> 
. mr . <unk> , of <unk> <unk> , is <unk> already in the matter , but he <unk> me 
that he <unk> no <unk> to your co - operation , and that he even thinks that it might be 
of some <unk> . i will call at four o ' clock in the afternoon , and , should you 
have any other <unk> at that time , i hope that you will <unk> it , as this matter is 
of <unk> importance . yours <unk> , st . <unk> .' " it is dated from <unk> <unk> , written 
with a <unk> <unk> , and the noble <unk> has had the <unk> to get a <unk> of <unk> upon 
the <unk> side of his right little <unk> ," remarked holmes as he <unk> up the epistle . " he 
<unk> four o ' clock . it is three now . he will be here in an hour ." " 
then i have just time , with your <unk> , to get clear upon the subject . turn over those 
papers and <unk> the <unk> in their order of time , while i take a glance as to who our 
client is ." he <unk> a red - <unk> volume from a line of books of <unk> beside the <unk> 
. " here he is ," said he , sitting down and <unk> it out upon his <unk> . "' 
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> st . <unk> , second <unk> of the duke of <unk> .' hum ! ' 
arms : <unk> , three <unk> in <unk> over a <unk> <unk> . born in <unk> .' he ' s 
<unk> - one years of <unk> , which is <unk> for marriage . was under - <unk> for the <unk> 
in a late <unk> . the duke , his <unk> , was at one time <unk> for <unk> affairs . 
they <unk> <unk> blood by <unk> <unk> , and <unk> on the <unk> side . ha ! well , there 
is nothing very <unk> in all this . i think that i must turn to you watson , for something 
more <unk> ." " i have very little <unk> in <unk> what i want ," said i , " for 
the facts are quite recent , and the matter struck me as remarkable . i <unk> to <unk> them to 
you , however , as i knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you <unk> the <unk> 
of other matters ." " oh , you mean the little problem of the <unk> <unk> furniture <unk> . that 
is quite <unk> up now -- though , indeed , it was <unk> from the first . pray give me 
the results of your <unk> <unk> ." " here is the first notice which i can find . it is 
in the <unk> <unk> of the morning post , and <unk> , as you see , some <unk> back : 
' a marriage has been arranged ,' it <unk> , ' and will , if <unk> is <unk> , very 
shortly take <unk> , between <unk> <unk> st . <unk> , second <unk> of the duke of <unk> , and 
miss <unk> <unk> , the only daughter of <unk> <unk> . esq <unk> of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> 
. s . a .' that is all ." " <unk> and to the point ," remarked holmes , <unk> 
his long , <unk> legs towards the fire . " there was a <unk> <unk> this in one of the 
society papers of the same week . ah , here it is : ' there will soon be a call 
for <unk> in the marriage <unk> , for the present <unk> - <unk> <unk> appears to tell <unk> against our 
home <unk> . one by one the <unk> of the noble houses of great <unk> is passing into the hands 
of our <unk> <unk> from across the <unk> . an important <unk> has been made during the last week to 
the <unk> of the <unk> which have been borne away by these <unk> <unk> . <unk> st . <unk> , 
who has shown himself for over twenty years <unk> against the little god ' s <unk> , has now <unk> 
<unk> his <unk> marriage with miss <unk> <unk> , the <unk> daughter of a <unk> <unk> . miss <unk> , 
whose <unk> figure and <unk> face attracted much attention at the <unk> house <unk> , is an only child , 
and it is <unk> <unk> that her <unk> will run to <unk> over the six figures , with <unk> for 
the future . as it is an open secret that the duke of <unk> has been compelled to sell his 
<unk> within the last few years , and as <unk> st . <unk> has no <unk> of his own save 
the small <unk> of <unk> , it is <unk> that the <unk> <unk> is not the only <unk> by an 
<unk> which will <unk> her to make the easy and <unk> <unk> from a <unk> lady to a <unk> <unk> 
<unk> " anything else ?" asked holmes , <unk> . " oh , yes ; <unk> . then there is 
another note in the morning post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one , that it 
would be at st . <unk> ' s , <unk> <unk> , that only half a dozen <unk> <unk> would 
be <unk> , and that the <unk> would return to the furnished house at <unk> <unk> which has been taken 
by mr . <unk> <unk> . two days later -- that is , on <unk> last -- there is a 
<unk> <unk> that the <unk> had taken <unk> , and that the <unk> would be passed at <unk> <unk> ' 
s <unk> , near <unk> . those are all the <unk> which appeared before the <unk> of the bride ." 
" before the what ?" asked holmes with a start . " the <unk> of the lady ." " when 
did she <unk> , then ?" " at the <unk> <unk> ." " indeed . this is more interesting than 
it <unk> to be ; quite <unk> , in <unk> ." " yes ; it struck me as being a 
little out of the <unk> ." " they often <unk> before the <unk> , and occasionally during the <unk> ; 
but i <unk> call to mind anything quite so prompt as this . pray let me have the details ." 
" i <unk> you that they are very <unk> ." " perhaps we may make them less so ." " 
such as they are , they are <unk> <unk> in a single <unk> of a morning paper of yesterday , 
which i will read to you . it is headed , ' singular <unk> at a <unk> <unk> <unk> "'

to <unk> the matter up , so much <unk> attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose 
can be <unk> by <unk> to <unk> what is a <unk> subject for <unk> . "' the <unk> , which 
was <unk> at st . <unk> ' s , <unk> <unk> , was a very quiet one , no one 
being present save the <unk> of the bride , mr . <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> , <unk>

and lady <unk> <unk> . the whole <unk> <unk> afterwards to the house of mr . <unk> <unk> , at 
<unk> <unk> , where <unk> had been <unk> . it appears that some little <unk> was caused by a woman 
, whose name has not been <unk> , who <unk> to <unk> her way into the house after the <unk> 
<unk> , <unk> that she had some <unk> upon <unk> st . <unk> . it was only after a <unk> 
and <unk> scene that she was <unk> by the <unk> and the <unk> . the bride , who had <unk> 
entered the house before this <unk> <unk> , had sat down to <unk> with the rest , when she <unk> 
of a <unk> <unk> and retired to her room . her <unk> <unk> having caused some <unk> , her <unk> 
followed her , but <unk> from her maid that she had only come up to her chamber for an instant

very energetic <unk> are being made , which will probably result in a <unk> clearing up of this very singular 
business . up to a late hour last night , however , nothing had <unk> as to the <unk> of 
the <unk> lady . there are <unk> of <unk> play in the matter , and it is said that the 
police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the <unk> <unk> , in the <unk> that , 
from <unk> or some other <unk> , she may have been <unk> in the strange <unk> of the bride <unk> 
" and is that all ?" " only one little <unk> in another of the morning papers , but it 
is a suggestive one ." " and it is --" " that miss <unk> <unk> , the lady who had

watson . draw up a little to the fire , and we will <unk> this matter over ." " a 
most <unk> matter to me , as you can most <unk> imagine , mr . holmes . i have been 
<unk> to the quick . i understand that you have already <unk> several delicate cases of this sort , sir 
, though i <unk> that they were hardly from the same <unk> of society ." " no , i am 
<unk> ." " i <unk> <unk> ." " my last client of the sort was a king ." " oh 
, really ! i had no <unk> . and which king ?" " the king of scandinavia ." " what 
! had he lost his wife ?" " you can understand ," said holmes <unk> , " that i <unk> 
to the affairs of my other <unk> the same secrecy which i promise to you in yours ." " of 
course ! very right ! very right ! i ' <unk> sure i <unk> <unk> . as to my own 
case , i am <unk> to give you any information which may <unk> you in <unk> an <unk> ." " 
thank you . i have already <unk> all that is in the <unk> <unk> , nothing more . i <unk> 
that i may take it as <unk> -- this <unk> , for example , as to the <unk> of the 
bride ." <unk> st . <unk> glanced over it . " yes , it is <unk> , as far as 
it goes ." " but it <unk> a great deal of <unk> before anyone could <unk> an <unk> . i 
think that i may <unk> at my facts most <unk> by questioning you ." " pray do so ." " 
when did you first meet miss <unk> <unk> ?" " in <unk> <unk> , a year ago ." " you 
were <unk> in the <unk> ?" " yes ." " did you <unk> engaged then ?" " no ." " 
but you were on a <unk> <unk> ?" " i was <unk> by her society , and she could see 
that i was <unk> ." " her <unk> is very rich ?" " he is said to be the <unk> 
man on the <unk> <unk> ." " and how did he make his money ?" " in <unk> . he 
had nothing a few years ago . then he struck gold , <unk> it , and came up by <unk> 
and <unk> ." " now , what is your own impression as to the young lady ' s -- your 
wife ' s character ?" the nobleman <unk> his <unk> a little faster and <unk> down into the fire . 
" you see , mr . holmes ," said he , " my wife was twenty before her <unk> became 
a rich man . during that time she ran <unk> in a <unk> <unk> and <unk> through <unk> or <unk> 
, so that her <unk> has come from nature rather than from the <unk> . she is what we call 
in england a <unk> , with a strong nature , <unk> and <unk> , <unk> by any sort of <unk> 
. she is <unk> -- <unk> , i was about to say . she is <unk> in making up her 
mind and <unk> in <unk> out her <unk> . on the other hand , i would not have given her 
the name which i have the honour to bear <unk> he gave a little <unk> <unk> --" had not i 
thought her to be at <unk> a noble woman . i believe that she is capable of <unk> self - 
<unk> and that anything <unk> would be <unk> to her ." " have you her photograph ?" " i brought 
this with me ." he opened a <unk> and showed us the <unk> face of a very lovely woman . 
it was not a photograph but an <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> had brought out the <unk> <unk> of 
the <unk> black <unk> , the large dark eyes , and the <unk> mouth . holmes <unk> long and earnestly 
at it . then he <unk> the <unk> and handed it back to <unk> st . <unk> . " the 
young lady came to london , then , and you <unk> your acquaintance ?" " yes , her <unk> brought 
her over for this last london <unk> . i <unk> her several times , became engaged to her , and 
have now married her ." " she brought , i understand , a <unk> <unk> ?" " a <unk> <unk> 
. not more than is usual in my family ." " and this , of course , remains to you 
, since the marriage is a <unk> <unk> ?" " i really have made no <unk> on the subject ." 
" very naturally not . did you see miss <unk> on the day before the <unk> ?" " yes ." 
" was she in good <unk> ?" " never better . she <unk> talking of what we should do in 
our future lives ." " indeed ! that is very interesting . and on the morning of the <unk> ?" 
" she was as <unk> as <unk> -- at least until after the <unk> ." " and did you observe 
any change in her then ?" " well , to tell the <unk> , i saw then the first signs 
that i had ever seen that her <unk> was just a little sharp . the <unk> however , was too 
<unk> to <unk> and can have no <unk> <unk> upon the case ." " pray let us have it , 
for all that ." " oh , it is <unk> . she dropped her <unk> as we went towards the 
<unk> . she was passing the front <unk> at the time , and it fell over into the <unk> . 
there was a moment ' s delay , but the gentleman in the <unk> handed it up to her again 
, and it did not <unk> to be the <unk> for the fall . yet when i spoke to her 
of the matter , she answered me <unk> ; and in the carriage , on our way home , she 
seemed <unk> <unk> over this trifling cause ." " indeed ! you say that there was a gentleman in the 
<unk> . some of the general <unk> were present , then ?" " oh , yes . it is <unk> 
to <unk> them when the church is open ." " this gentleman was not one of your wife ' s 
<unk> ?" " no , no ; i call him a gentleman by <unk> , but he was quite a 
<unk> - looking person . i hardly <unk> his appearance . but really i think that we are <unk> rather 
far from the point ." " lady st . <unk> , then , returned from the <unk> in a less 
<unk> <unk> of mind than she had gone to it . what did she do on re - <unk> her 
<unk> ' s house ?" " i saw her in <unk> with her maid ." " and who is her 
maid ?" " <unk> is her name . she is an <unk> and came from <unk> with her ." " 
a <unk> servant ?" " a little too much so . it seemed to me that her mistress <unk> her 
to take great <unk> . still , of course , in <unk> they look upon these things in a different 
way ." " how long did she speak to this <unk> ?" " oh , a few minutes . i 
had something else to think of ." " you did not <unk> what they said ?" " lady st . 
<unk> said something about ' <unk> a <unk> .' she was accustomed to use <unk> of the kind . i 
have no <unk> what she <unk> ." " <unk> <unk> is very <unk> <unk> . and what did your wife 
do when she finished speaking to her maid ?" " she walked into the <unk> - room ." " on 
your arm ?" " no , alone . she was very <unk> in little matters like that . then , 
after we had sat down for ten minutes or so , she rose hurriedly , <unk> some <unk> of <unk> 
, and left the room . she never came back ." " but this maid , <unk> , as i 
understand , <unk> that she went to her room , <unk> her bride ' s dress with a long ulster 
, put on a bonnet , and went out ." " quite so . and she was afterwards seen walking 
into <unk> park in company with <unk> <unk> , a woman who is now in <unk> , and who had 
already made a <unk> at mr . <unk> ' s house that morning ." " ah , yes . i 
should like a few <unk> as to this young lady , and your <unk> to her ." <unk> st . 
<unk> shrugged his shoulders and raised his <unk> . " we have been on a <unk> <unk> for some years 
-- i may say on a very <unk> <unk> . she <unk> to be at the <unk> . i have 
not <unk> her <unk> , and she had no just cause of <unk> against me , but you know what 
women are , mr . holmes . <unk> was a dear little thing , but <unk> hot - headed and 
<unk> <unk> to me . she wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that i was about to be married 
, and , to tell the <unk> , the reason why i had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that 
i <unk> <unk> there might be a scandal in the church . she came to mr . <unk> ' s 
door just after we returned , and she <unk> to <unk> her way in , <unk> very <unk> <unk> towards 
my wife , and even <unk> her , but i had <unk> the possibility of something of the sort , 
and i had two police <unk> there in private clothes , who soon pushed her out again . she was 
quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a row ." " did your wife hear all 
this ?" " no , thank <unk> , she did not ." " and she was seen walking with this 
very woman afterwards ?" " yes . that is what mr . <unk> , of <unk> <unk> , <unk> upon 
as so serious . it is thought that <unk> <unk> my wife out and laid some <unk> <unk> for her 
." " well , it is a <unk> <unk> ." " you think so , too ?" " i did 
not say a probable one . but you do not yourself look upon this as likely ?" " i do 
not think <unk> would hurt a <unk> ." " still , <unk> is a strange <unk> of <unk> . pray 
what is your own <unk> as to what took <unk> ?" " well , really , i came to <unk> 
a <unk> , not to <unk> one . i have given you all the facts . since you <unk> me 
, however , i may say that it has <unk> to me as <unk> that the <unk> of this <unk> 
, the <unk> that she had made so immense a <unk> <unk> , had the <unk> of <unk> some little 
nervous <unk> in my wife ." " in <unk> , that she had <unk> suddenly <unk> ?" " well , 
really , when i <unk> that she has turned her back -- i will not say upon me , but 
upon so much that many have <unk> to without success -- i can hardly explain it in any other fashion 
." " well , certainly that is also a <unk> <unk> ," said holmes , <unk> . " and now 
, <unk> st . <unk> , i think that i have nearly all my data . may i <unk> whether 
you were <unk> at the <unk> - table so that you could see out of the window ?" " we 
could see the other side of the road and the park ." " quite so . then i do not 
think that i need to <unk> you <unk> . i shall communicate with you ." " should you be fortunate 
enough to <unk> this problem ," said our client , <unk> . " i have <unk> it ." " <unk> 
? what was that ?" " i say that i have <unk> it ." " where , then , is 
my wife ?" " that is a <unk> which i shall <unk> <unk> ." <unk> st . <unk> <unk> his 
head . " i am <unk> that it will take <unk> heads than yours or mine ," he remarked , 
and <unk> in a <unk> , old - <unk> manner he departed . " it is very good of <unk> 
st . <unk> to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own ," said sherlock holmes 
, laughing . " i think that i shall have a <unk> and <unk> and a cigar after all this 
cross - questioning . i had <unk> my <unk> as to the case before our client came into the room 
." " my dear holmes !" " i have notes of several <unk> cases , though none , as i 
remarked before , which were quite as prompt . my whole <unk> <unk> to turn my <unk> into a <unk> 
. <unk> <unk> is occasionally very <unk> , as when you find a <unk> in the <unk> , to <unk> 
<unk> ' s example ." " but i have heard all that you have heard ." " without , however 
, the <unk> of <unk> - <unk> cases which <unk> me so well . there was a parallel instance in 
<unk> some years back , and something on very much the same <unk> at <unk> the year after the <unk> 
- <unk> <unk> . it is one of these cases -- but , <unk> , here is <unk> ! good 
- afternoon , <unk> ! you will find an <unk> <unk> upon the <unk> , and there are cigars in 
the box ." the official <unk> was <unk> in a <unk> - <unk> and <unk> , which gave him a 
<unk> <unk> appearance , and he carried a black <unk> bag in his hand . with a <unk> greeting he 
<unk> himself and lit the cigar which had been <unk> to him . " what ' s up , then 
?" asked holmes with a <unk> in his eye . " you look <unk> ." " and i <unk> <unk> 
. it is this <unk> st . <unk> marriage case . i can make neither head nor <unk> of the 
business ." " really ! you surprise me ." " who ever heard of such a <unk> <unk> ? every 
<unk> seems to <unk> through my <unk> . i have been at work upon it all day ." " and 
very wet it seems to have made you ," said holmes <unk> his hand upon the arm of the <unk> 
- <unk> . " yes , i have been <unk> the serpentine ." " in <unk> ' s name , 
what for ?" " in search of the <unk> of lady st . <unk> ." sherlock holmes <unk> back in 
his chair and laughed heartily . " have you dragged the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ?" he asked . 
" why ? what do you mean ?" " because you have just as good a chance of <unk> this 
lady in the one as in the other ." <unk> shot an <unk> glance at my companion . " i 
suppose you know all about it ," he <unk> . " well , i have only just heard the facts 
, but my mind is made up ." " oh , indeed ! then you think that the serpentine <unk> 
no part in the matter ?" " i think it very unlikely ." " then perhaps you will kindly explain 
how it is that we found this in it ?" he opened his bag as he spoke , and <unk> 
<unk> the floor a <unk> - dress of <unk> silk , a pair of white <unk> <unk> and a bride 
' s <unk> and veil , all <unk> and <unk> in <unk> . " there ," said he , putting 
a new <unk> - ring upon the top of the <unk> . " there is a little <unk> for you 
to crack , master holmes ." " oh , indeed !" said my friend , <unk> blue <unk> into the 
air . " you dragged them from the serpentine ?" " no . they were found <unk> near the <unk> 
by a park - <unk> . they have been <unk> as her clothes , and it seemed to me that 
if the clothes were there the <unk> would not be far off ." " by the same <unk> reasoning , 
every man ' s <unk> is to be found in the neighbourhood of his <unk> . and pray what did 
you hope to <unk> at through this ?" " at some <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> ." " 
i am <unk> that you will find it difficult ." " are you , indeed , now ?" cried <unk> 
with some <unk> . " i am <unk> , holmes , that you are not very <unk> with your <unk> 
and your <unk> . you have made two <unk> in as many minutes . this dress does <unk> miss <unk> 
<unk> ." " and how ?" " in the dress is a pocket . in the pocket is a <unk> 
- case . in the <unk> - case is a note . and here is the very note ." he 
<unk> it down upon the table in front of him . " listen to this : ' you will see 
me when all is <unk> . come at once . <unk> . <unk> . <unk> .' now my <unk> all 
<unk> has been that lady st . <unk> was <unk> away by <unk> <unk> , and that she , with 
<unk> , no doubt , was <unk> for her <unk> . here , <unk> with her <unk> , is the 
very note which was no doubt quietly <unk> into her hand at the door and which <unk> her within their 
reach ." " very good , <unk> ," said holmes , laughing . " you really are very fine indeed 
. let me see it ." he took up the paper in a <unk> way , but his attention <unk> 
became <unk> , and he gave a little cry of satisfaction . " this is indeed important ," said he 
. " ha ! you find it so ?" " <unk> so . i <unk> you <unk> ." <unk> rose 
in his <unk> and <unk> his head to look . " why ," he <unk> , " you ' re 
looking at the <unk> side !" " on the contrary , this is the right side ." " the right 
side ? you ' re mad ! here is the note written in <unk> over here ." " and over 
here is what appears to be the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> , which interests me deeply ." " there 
' s nothing in it . i looked at it before ," said <unk> . "' <unk> . <unk> , 
rooms <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> <unk> glass <unk> , <unk> 
.' i see nothing in that ." " very likely not . it is most important , all the same 
. as to the note , it is important also , or at least the <unk> are , so i 
<unk> you again ." " i ' ve <unk> time enough ," said <unk> , <unk> . " i believe 
in hard work and not in sitting by the fire <unk> fine theories . good - day , mr . 
holmes , and we shall see which <unk> to the <unk> of the matter first ." he <unk> up the 
<unk> , <unk> them into the bag , and made for the door . " just one <unk> to you 
, <unk> ," <unk> holmes before his <unk> vanished ; " i will tell you the true <unk> of the 
matter . lady st . <unk> is a <unk> . there is not , and there never has been , 
any such person ." <unk> looked <unk> at my companion . then he turned to me , <unk> his forehead 
three times , <unk> his head solemnly , and hurried away . he had hardly <unk> the door behind him 
when holmes rose to put on his <unk> . " there is something in what the fellow <unk> about <unk> 
work ," he remarked , " so i think , watson , that i must leave you to your papers 
for a little ." it was after five o ' clock when sherlock holmes left me , but i had 
no time to be <unk> , for within an hour there arrived a <unk> ' s man with a very 
large <unk> box . this he <unk> with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him , 
and presently , to my very great <unk> , a quite <unk> little cold <unk> began to be laid out 
upon our <unk> <unk> - house <unk> . there were a <unk> of <unk> of cold <unk> , a <unk> 
, a <unk> <unk> <unk> © <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a group of <unk> and <unk> <unk> . having 
laid out all these <unk> , my two <unk> vanished away , like the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , 
with no <unk> save that the things had been paid for and were <unk> to this address . just before 
<unk> o ' clock sherlock holmes stepped <unk> into the room . his features were <unk> <unk> , but there 
was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been <unk> in his <unk> . 
" they have laid the <unk> , then ," he said , rubbing his hands . " you <unk> to 
<unk> company . they have laid for five ." " yes , i fancy we may have some company <unk> 
in ," said he . " i am <unk> that <unk> st . <unk> has not already arrived . ha 
! i fancy that i hear his step now upon the stairs ." it was indeed our visitor of the 
afternoon who came <unk> in , <unk> his <unk> more <unk> than ever , and with a very <unk> expression 
upon his <unk> features . " my <unk> reached you , then ?" asked holmes . " yes , and 
i confess that the <unk> startled me beyond <unk> . have you good <unk> for what you say ?" " 
the best <unk> ." <unk> st . <unk> <unk> into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead . 
" what will the duke say ," he murmured , " when he <unk> that one of the family has 
been <unk> to such <unk> ?" " it is the <unk> <unk> . i <unk> <unk> that there is any 
<unk> ." " ah , you look on these things from another <unk> ." " i fail to see that 
anyone is to <unk> . i can hardly see how the lady could have <unk> <unk> , though her <unk> 
<unk> of doing it was <unk> to be <unk> . having no <unk> , she had no one to advise 
her at such a <unk> ." " it was a <unk> , sir , a <unk> <unk> ," said <unk> 
st . <unk> , <unk> his <unk> upon the table . " you must make <unk> for this poor girl 
, placed in so <unk> a position ." " i will make no <unk> . i am very <unk> indeed 
, and i have been <unk> <unk> ." " i think that i heard a ring ," said holmes . 
" yes , there are steps on the <unk> . if i <unk> <unk> you to take a <unk> view 
of the matter , <unk> st . <unk> , i have brought an <unk> here who may be more successful 
." he opened the door and <unk> in a lady and gentleman . " <unk> st . <unk> ," said 
he " <unk> me to introduce you to mr . and mrs . <unk> <unk> <unk> . the lady , 
i think , you have already <unk> ." at the <unk> of these <unk> our client had <unk> from his 
seat and stood very <unk> , with his eyes <unk> down and his hand <unk> into the <unk> of his 
<unk> - coat , a <unk> of <unk> <unk> . the lady had taken a quick step forward and had 
<unk> out her hand to him , but he still refused to raise his eyes . it was as well 
for his resolution , perhaps , for her <unk> face was one which it was hard to <unk> . " 
you ' re <unk> , <unk> ," said she . " well , i guess you have every cause to 
be ." " pray make no <unk> to me ," said <unk> st . <unk> <unk> . " oh , 
yes , i know that i have <unk> you <unk> bad and that i should have spoken to you before 
i went ; but i was kind of rattled , and from the time when i saw <unk> here again 
i just <unk> ' t know what i was doing or <unk> . i only wonder i <unk> ' t 
fall down and do a <unk> right there before the altar ." " perhaps , mrs . <unk> , you 
would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter ?" " if i may 
give an <unk> ," remarked the strange gentleman , " we ' ve had just a little too much secrecy 
over this business already . for my part , i should like all europe and <unk> to hear the <unk> 
of it ." he was a small , <unk> , <unk> man , <unk> - <unk> , with a sharp 
face and <unk> manner . " then i ' ll tell our story right away ," said the lady . 
" <unk> here and i <unk> in ' <unk> , in <unk> ' s <unk> , near the <unk> , 
where <unk> was <unk> a <unk> . we were engaged to each other , <unk> and i ; but then 
one day <unk> struck a rich pocket and made a <unk> , while poor <unk> here had a <unk> that 
<unk> out and came to nothing . the <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> was <unk> ; so at last <unk> 
<unk> ' t hear of our <unk> <unk> any <unk> , and he took me away to ' <unk> . 
<unk> <unk> ' t throw up his hand , though ; so he followed me there , and he saw 
me without <unk> <unk> anything about it . it would only have made him mad to know , so we 
just <unk> it all up for ourselves . <unk> said that he would go and make his <unk> , too 
, and never come back to <unk> me until he had as much as <unk> . so then i <unk> 
to wait for him to the end of time and <unk> myself not to marry anyone else while he lived 
. ' why <unk> ' t we be married right away , then ,' said he , ' and then 
i will <unk> sure of you ; and i won ' t <unk> to be your husband until i come 
back ?' well , we <unk> it over , and he had <unk> it all up so nicely , with 
a clergyman all <unk> in waiting , that we just did it right there ; and then <unk> went off 
to <unk> his <unk> , and i went back to <unk> . " the next i heard of <unk> was 
that he was in <unk> , and then he went <unk> in <unk> , and then i heard of him 
from new <unk> . after that came a long <unk> story about how a <unk> ' <unk> had been <unk> 
by <unk> <unk> , and there was my <unk> ' s name among the <unk> . i <unk> dead away 
, and i was very <unk> for months after . <unk> thought i had a <unk> and took me to 
half the <unk> in ' <unk> . not a word of news came for a year and more , so 
that i never <unk> that <unk> was really dead . then <unk> st . <unk> came to ' <unk> , 
and we came to london , and a marriage was arranged , and <unk> was very <unk> , but i 
felt all the time that no man on this <unk> would ever take the <unk> in my heart that had 
been given to my poor <unk> . " still , if i had married <unk> st . <unk> , of 
course i ' <unk> have done my <unk> by him . we can ' t <unk> our love , but 
we can our actions . i went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as 
good a wife as it was in me to be . but you may imagine what i felt when , 
just as i came to the altar <unk> , i glanced back and saw <unk> standing and looking at me 
out of the first <unk> . i thought it was his <unk> at first ; but when i looked again 
there he was still , with a kind of question in his eyes , as if to <unk> me whether 
i were glad or sorry to see him . i wonder i <unk> ' t drop . i know that 
<unk> was <unk> round , and the <unk> of the clergyman were just like the <unk> of a <unk> in 
my ear . i <unk> ' t know what to do . should i <unk> the <unk> and make a 
scene in the church ? i glanced at him again , and he seemed to know what i was <unk> 
, for he raised his <unk> to his <unk> to tell me to be still . then i saw him 
<unk> on a <unk> of paper , and i knew that he was writing me a note . as i 
passed his <unk> on the way out i dropped my <unk> over to him , and he <unk> the note 
into my hand when he returned me the <unk> . it was only a line <unk> me to join him 
when he made the sign to me to do so . of course i never <unk> for a moment that 
my first <unk> was now to him , and i determined to do just whatever he might <unk> . " 
when i got back i told my maid , who had known him in <unk> , and had always been 
his friend . i <unk> her to say nothing , but to get a few things <unk> and my ulster 
<unk> . i know i <unk> to have spoken to <unk> st . <unk> , but it was dreadful hard 
before his <unk> and all those great people . i just made up my mind to run away and explain 
afterwards . i hadn ' t been at the table ten minutes before i saw <unk> out of the window 
at the other side of the road . he <unk> to me and then began walking into the park . 
i <unk> out , put on my things , and followed him . some woman came talking something or other 
about <unk> st . <unk> to me -- seemed to me from the little i heard as if he had 
a little secret of his own before marriage also -- but i <unk> to get away from her and soon 
<unk> <unk> . we got into a cab together , and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken 
in <unk> <unk> , and that was my true <unk> after all those years of waiting . <unk> had been 
a <unk> among the <unk> , had escaped , came on to ' <unk> , found that i had given 
him up for dead and had gone to england , followed me there , and had come upon me at 
last on the very morning of my second <unk> ." " i saw it in a paper ," explained the 
<unk> . " it gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived ." " then we 
had a <unk> as to what we should do , and <unk> was all for <unk> , but i was 
so ashamed of it all that i felt as if i should like to <unk> away and never see any 
of them again -- just <unk> a line to <unk> , perhaps , to show him that i was <unk> 
. it was <unk> to me to think of all those <unk> and <unk> sitting round that <unk> - table 
and waiting for me to come back . so <unk> took my <unk> - clothes and things and made a 
<unk> of them , so that i should not be <unk> , and dropped them away <unk> where no one 
could find them . it is likely that we should have gone on to <unk> to - morrow , only 
that this good gentleman , mr . holmes , came round to us this evening , though how he found 
us is more than i can think , and he showed us very <unk> and kindly that i was <unk> 
and that <unk> was right , and that we should be putting ourselves in the <unk> if we were so 
secret . then he <unk> to give us a chance of talking to <unk> st . <unk> alone , and 
so we came right away round to his rooms at once . now , <unk> , you have heard it 
all , and i am very sorry if i have given you <unk> , and i hope that you do 
not think very <unk> of me ." <unk> st . <unk> had by no means <unk> his <unk> attitude , 
but had listened with a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> lip to this long <unk> . " excuse me ," 
he said , " but it is not my <unk> to discuss my most <unk> <unk> affairs in this <unk> 
manner ." " then you won ' t <unk> me ? you won ' t shake hands before i go 
?" " oh , certainly , if it would give you any pleasure ." he put out his hand and 
coldly <unk> that which she extended to him . " i had <unk> ," suggested holmes , " that you 
would have joined us in a <unk> <unk> ." " i think that there you <unk> a little too much 
," responded his <unk> . " i may be <unk> to <unk> in these recent <unk> , but i can 
hardly be expected to make <unk> over them . i think that with your <unk> i will now wish you 
all a very good - night ." he included us all in a <unk> <unk> and <unk> out of the 
room . " then i trust that you at least will honour me with your company ," said sherlock holmes 
. " it is always a <unk> to meet an <unk> , mr . <unk> , for i am one 
of those who believe that the <unk> of a <unk> and the <unk> of a <unk> in far - gone 
years will not <unk> our <unk> from being some day <unk> of the same world - <unk> country under a 
<unk> which shall be a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> with the <unk> and <unk> ." " the case has 
been an interesting one ," remarked holmes when our <unk> had left us , " because it <unk> to show 
very <unk> how simple the <unk> may be of an <unk> which at first <unk> seems to be almost <unk> 
. nothing could be more <unk> than the <unk> of <unk> as <unk> by this lady , and nothing <unk> 
than the result when <unk> , for instance , by mr . <unk> of <unk> <unk> ." " you were 
not yourself at <unk> at all , then ?" " from the first , two facts were very <unk> to 
me , the one that the lady had been quite <unk> to <unk> the <unk> <unk> , the other that 
she had <unk> of it within a few minutes of returning home . obviously something had <unk> during the morning 
, then , to cause her to change her mind . what could that something be ? she could not 
have spoken to anyone when she was out , for she had been in the company of the bridegroom . 
had she seen someone , then ? if she had , it must be someone from <unk> because she had 
<unk> so <unk> a time in this country that she could hardly have <unk> anyone to <unk> so deep an 
influence over her that the <unk> <unk> of him would <unk> her to change her plans so completely . you 
see we have already arrived , by a process of <unk> , at the <unk> that she might have seen 
an <unk> . then who could this <unk> be , and why should he possess so much influence over her 
? it might be a lover ; it might be a husband . her young <unk> had , i knew 
, been <unk> in rough <unk> and under strange <unk> . so far i had got before i ever heard 
<unk> st . <unk> ' s <unk> . when he told us of a man in a <unk> , of 
the change in the bride ' s manner , of so <unk> a <unk> for <unk> a note as the 
<unk> of a <unk> , of her <unk> to her <unk> maid , and of her very <unk> <unk> to 
<unk> - <unk> -- which in <unk> ' <unk> means taking <unk> of that which another person has a <unk> 
<unk> to -- the whole situation became absolutely clear . she had gone off with a man , and the 
man was either a lover or was a <unk> husband -- the chances being in <unk> of the latter ." 
" and how in the world did you find them ?" " it might have been difficult , but friend 
<unk> <unk> information in his hands the <unk> of which he did not himself know . the <unk> were , 
of course , of the <unk> importance , but more <unk> still was it to know that within a week 
he had <unk> his <unk> at one of the most <unk> london <unk> ." " how did you deduce the 
<unk> ?" " by the <unk> <unk> . eight <unk> for a <unk> and <unk> for a glass of <unk> 
<unk> to one of the most <unk> <unk> . there are not many in london which <unk> at that <unk> 
. in the second one which i <unk> in <unk> avenue , i <unk> by an <unk> of the book 
that <unk> <unk> . <unk> , an <unk> gentleman , had left only the day before , and on looking 
over the <unk> against him , i came upon the very <unk> which i had seen in the <unk> <unk> 
. his letters were to be <unk> to <unk> <unk> <unk> ; so <unk> i travelled , and being fortunate 
enough to find the <unk> <unk> at home , i <unk> to give them some <unk> <unk> and to point 
out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little <unk> 
both to the general <unk> and to <unk> st . <unk> in <unk> . i <unk> them to meet him 
here , and , as you see , i made him keep the <unk> ." " but with no very 
good result ," i remarked . " his conduct was certainly not very <unk> ." " ah , watson ," 
said holmes , <unk> , " perhaps you would not be very <unk> either , if , after all the 
<unk> of wooing and <unk> , you found yourself <unk> in an instant of wife and of <unk> . i 
think that we may <unk> <unk> st . <unk> very <unk> and thank our <unk> that we are never likely 
to find ourselves in the same position . draw your chair up and hand me my <unk> , for the 
only problem we have still to <unk> is how to while away these <unk> <unk> <unk> ." xi . the 
adventure of the beryl coronet " holmes ," said i as i stood one morning in our <unk> - window 
looking down the street , " here is a <unk> coming <unk> . it seems rather <unk> that his <unk> 
should <unk> him to come out alone ." my friend rose <unk> from his armchair and stood with his hands 
in the pockets of his <unk> - <unk> , looking over my shoulder . it was a <unk> , <unk> 
<unk> morning , and the <unk> of the day before still lay deep upon the ground , <unk> <unk> in 
the <unk> <unk> . down the centre of baker street it had been <unk> into a brown <unk> band by 
the <unk> , but at either side and on the <unk> - up edges of the <unk> - <unk> it 
still lay as white as when it fell . the <unk> pavement had been <unk> and scraped , but was 
still <unk> <unk> , so that there were <unk> <unk> than usual . indeed , from the direction of the 
<unk> station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose <unk> conduct had drawn my attention . he was 
a man of about fifty , tall , <unk> , and <unk> , with a <unk> , strongly marked face 
and a <unk> figure . he was dressed in a <unk> yet rich <unk> , in black <unk> - coat 
, <unk> hat , neat brown <unk> , and well - <unk> <unk> - <unk> trousers . yet his actions 
were in <unk> <unk> to the <unk> of his dress and features , for he was running hard , with 
<unk> little <unk> , such as a <unk> man gives who is little accustomed to <unk> any <unk> upon his 
legs . as he ran he <unk> his hands up and down , <unk> his head , and <unk> his 
face into the most extraordinary <unk> . " what on <unk> can be the matter with him ?" i asked 
. " he is looking up at the <unk> of the houses ." " i believe that he is coming 
here ," said holmes , rubbing his hands . " here ?" " yes ; i rather think he is 
coming to consult me <unk> . i think that i <unk> the <unk> . ha ! did i not tell 
you ?" as he spoke , the man , <unk> and <unk> , rushed at our door and pulled at 
our bell until the whole house <unk> with the <unk> . a few <unk> later he was in our room 
, still <unk> , still <unk> , but with so <unk> a look of <unk> and <unk> in his eyes 
that our <unk> were turned in an instant to <unk> and pity . for a while he could not get 
his <unk> out , but <unk> his <unk> and <unk> at his <unk> like one who has been driven to 
the extreme <unk> of his reason . then , suddenly <unk> to his feet , he <unk> his head against 
the wall with such <unk> that we both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the 
room . sherlock holmes pushed him down into the easy - chair and , sitting beside him , <unk> his 
hand and <unk> with him in the easy , <unk> <unk> which he knew so well how to <unk> . 
" you have come to me to tell your story , have you not ?" said he . " you 
are <unk> with your <unk> . pray wait until you have recovered yourself , and then i shall be most 
<unk> to look into any little problem which you may <unk> to me ." the man sat for a <unk> 
or more with a <unk> chest , <unk> against his emotion . then he passed his <unk> over his <unk> 
, <unk> his <unk> <unk> , and turned his face towards us . " no doubt you think me mad 
?" said he . " i see that you have had some great <unk> ," responded holmes . " god 
knows i have <unk> a <unk> which is enough to <unk> my reason , so <unk> and so <unk> is 
it . <unk> <unk> i might have faced , <unk> i am a man whose character has never yet borne 
a <unk> . private <unk> also is the <unk> of every man ; but the two coming together , and 
in so <unk> a form , have been enough to shake my very soul . besides , it is not 
i alone . the very <unk> in the <unk> may <unk> <unk> some way be found out of this <unk> 
<unk> ." " pray <unk> yourself , sir ," said holmes , " and let me have a clear account 
of who you are and what it is that has <unk> you ." " my name ," answered our visitor 
, " is probably familiar to your <unk> . i am <unk> <unk> , of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> 
& <unk> , of <unk> street ." the name was indeed well known to us as <unk> to the <unk> 
<unk> in the second <unk> private <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of london . what could have <unk> , then 
, to bring one of the <unk> <unk> of london to this most <unk> pass ? we waited , all 
curiosity , until with another <unk> he <unk> himself to tell his story . " i <unk> that time is 
of <unk> ," said he ; " that is why i <unk> here when the police <unk> suggested that i 
should secure your co - operation . i came to baker street by the <unk> and hurried from there on 
<unk> , for the <unk> go slowly through this <unk> . that is why i was so out of <unk> 
, for i am a man who <unk> very little <unk> . i <unk> better now , and i will 
put the facts before you as shortly and yet as <unk> as i can . " it is , of 
course , well known to you that in a successful <unk> business as much <unk> upon our being able to 
find <unk> <unk> for our <unk> as upon our <unk> our <unk> and the number of our <unk> . one

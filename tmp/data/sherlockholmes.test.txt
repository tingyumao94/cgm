of our most <unk> means of <unk> out money is in the <unk> of <unk> , where the <unk> is 
<unk> . we have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years , and there are 
many noble families to whom we have <unk> large <unk> upon the <unk> of their <unk> , <unk> , or 
<unk> . " yesterday morning i was <unk> in my <unk> at the <unk> when a <unk> was brought in 
to me by one of the <unk> . i started when i saw the name , for it was that 
of none other than -- well , perhaps even to you i had better say no more than that it 
was a name which is a <unk> word all over the <unk> -- one of the <unk> , <unk> , 
most exalted <unk> in england . i was <unk> by the honour and <unk> , when he entered , to 
say so , but he <unk> at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry 
<unk> through a <unk> task . "' mr . <unk> ,' said he , ' i have been informed that 
you are in the habit of <unk> money .' "' the <unk> does so when the <unk> is good .' 
i answered . "' it is absolutely <unk> to me ,' said he , ' that i should have <unk> 
, <unk> pounds at once . i could , of course , <unk> so trifling a <unk> ten times over 
from my <unk> , but i much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out that 
business myself . in my position you can <unk> understand that it is <unk> to <unk> one ' s self 
under <unk> .' "' for how long , may i <unk> , do you want this <unk> ?' i asked 
. "' next monday i have a large <unk> <unk> to me , and i shall then most certainly <unk> 
what you <unk> , with whatever interest you think it right to <unk> . but it is very <unk> to 
me that the money should be paid at once .' "' i should be <unk> to <unk> it without <unk> 
<unk> from my own private purse ,' said i , ' were it not that the <unk> would be rather 
more than it could bear . if , on the other hand , i am to do it in the 
name of the <unk> , then in <unk> to my <unk> i must insist that , even in your case 
, every <unk> precaution should be taken .' "' i should much prefer to have it so ,' said he 
, <unk> up a <unk> , black <unk> case which he had laid beside his chair . ' you have 
<unk> heard of the beryl coronet ?' "' one of the most precious <unk> <unk> of the <unk> ,' said 
i . "' precisely .' he opened the case , and there , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> - coloured 
<unk> , lay the <unk> <unk> of <unk> which he had named . ' there are thirty - <unk> <unk> 
<unk> ,' said he , ' and the <unk> of the gold <unk> is <unk> . the <unk> <unk> would 
put the <unk> of the coronet at double the <unk> which i have asked . i am <unk> to leave 
it with you as my <unk> .' " i took the precious case into my hands and looked in some 
<unk> from it to my <unk> client . "' you doubt its <unk> ?' he asked . "' not at 
all . i only doubt --' "' the <unk> of my <unk> it . you may <unk> your mind at 
rest about that . i should not <unk> of doing so were it not absolutely certain that i should be 
able in four days to <unk> it . it is a <unk> matter of form . is the <unk> sufficient 
?' "' <unk> .' "' you understand , mr . <unk> , that i am <unk> you a strong <unk> 
of the <unk> which i have in you , <unk> upon all that i have heard of you . i 
rely upon you not only to be <unk> and to <unk> from all <unk> upon the matter but , above 
all , to preserve this coronet with every <unk> precaution because i need not say that a great <unk> scandal 
would be caused if any <unk> were to <unk> it . any <unk> to it would be almost as serious 
as its complete <unk> , for there are no <unk> in the world to <unk> these , and it would 
be <unk> to <unk> them . i leave it with you , however , with every <unk> , and i 
shall call for it in person on monday morning .' " <unk> that my client was <unk> to leave , 
i said no more but , <unk> for my <unk> , i <unk> him to pay over fifty <unk> <unk> 
notes . when i was alone once more , however , with the precious case lying upon the table in 
front of me , i could not but think with some <unk> of the immense <unk> which it <unk> upon 
me . there could be no doubt that , as it was a <unk> <unk> , a <unk> scandal would 
<unk> if any <unk> should occur to it . i already <unk> having ever <unk> to take <unk> of it 
. however , it was too late to <unk> the matter now , so i <unk> it up in my 
private safe and turned once more to my work . " when evening came i felt that it would be 
an <unk> to leave so precious a thing in the <unk> behind me . <unk> ' <unk> had been <unk> 
before now , and why should not mine be ? if so , how <unk> would be the position in 
which i should find myself ! i determined , therefore , that for the next few days i would always 
carry the case <unk> and forward with me , so that it might never be really out of my reach 
. with this intention , i called a cab and drove out to my house at <unk> , <unk> the 
jewel with me . i did not <unk> freely until i had taken it <unk> and <unk> it in the 
<unk> of my <unk> - room . " and now a word as to my <unk> , mr . holmes 
, for i wish you to thoroughly understand the situation . my groom and my <unk> <unk> out of the 
house , and may be <unk> <unk> <unk> . i have three maid - <unk> who have been with me 
a number of years and whose absolute <unk> is quite above suspicion . another , <unk> <unk> , the second 
waiting - maid , has only been in my <unk> a few months . she came with an excellent character 
, however , and has always given me satisfaction . she is a very pretty girl and has attracted <unk> 
who have occasionally <unk> about the <unk> . that is the only <unk> which we have found to her , 
but we believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way . " so much for the <unk> 
. my family itself is so small that it will not take me long to <unk> it . i am 
a <unk> and have an only <unk> , arthur . he has been a <unk> to me , mr . 
holmes -- a <unk> <unk> . i have no doubt that i am myself to <unk> . people tell me 
that i have <unk> him . very likely i have . when my dear wife <unk> i felt that he 
was all i had to love . i could not bear to see the smile <unk> even for a moment 
from his face . i have never <unk> him a wish . perhaps it would have been better for both 
of us had i been <unk> , but i <unk> it for the best . " it was naturally my 
intention that he should <unk> me in my business , but he was not of a business turn . he 
was <unk> , <unk> , and , to speak the <unk> , i could not trust him in the <unk> 
of large <unk> of money . when he was young he became a member of an <unk> <unk> , and 
there , having <unk> <unk> , he was soon the <unk> of a number of men with long <unk> and 
<unk> habits . he <unk> to play <unk> at <unk> and to <unk> money on the <unk> , until he 
had again and again to come to me and <unk> me to give him an <unk> upon his <unk> , 
that he might <unk> his <unk> of honour . he tried more than once to <unk> away from the <unk> 
company which he was keeping , but each time the influence of his friend , sir <unk> <unk> , was 
enough to draw him back again . " and , indeed , i could not wonder that such a man 
as sir <unk> <unk> should <unk> an influence over him , for he has frequently brought him to my house 
, and i have found myself that i could hardly <unk> the <unk> of his manner . he is <unk> 
than arthur , a man of the world to his <unk> - <unk> , one who had been <unk> , 
seen <unk> , a <unk> <unk> , and a man of great <unk> <unk> . yet when i think of 
him in cold blood , far away from the <unk> of his <unk> , i am <unk> from his <unk> 
<unk> and the look which i have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply <unk> 
. so i think , and so , too , thinks my little mary , who has a woman ' 
s quick <unk> into character . " and now there is only she to be <unk> . she is my 
<unk> ; but when my <unk> <unk> five years ago and left her alone in the world i adopted her 
, and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter . she is a <unk> in my house -- 
<unk> , <unk> , beautiful , a wonderful <unk> and <unk> , yet as <unk> and quiet and <unk> as 
a woman could be . she is my right hand . i do not know what i could do without 
her . in only one matter has she ever gone against my wishes . twice my boy has asked her 
to marry him , for he loves her <unk> , but each time she has refused him . i think 
that if anyone could have drawn him into the right <unk> it would have been she , and that his 
marriage might have changed his whole life ; but now , <unk> ! it is too late -- <unk> too 
late ! " now , mr . holmes , you know the people who <unk> under my <unk> , and 
i shall continue with my <unk> story . " when we were taking coffee in the drawing - room that 
night after dinner , i told arthur and mary my <unk> , and of the precious <unk> which we had 
under our <unk> , <unk> only the name of my client . <unk> <unk> , who had brought in the 
coffee , had , i am sure , left the room ; but i <unk> <unk> that the door was 
<unk> . mary and arthur were much interested and wished to see the <unk> coronet , but i thought it 
better not to <unk> it . "' where have you put it ?' asked arthur . "' in my own 
<unk> .' "' well , i hope to <unk> the house won ' t be burgled during the night .' 
said he . "' it is <unk> up ,' i answered . "' oh , any old key will <unk> 
that <unk> . when i was a <unk> i have opened it myself with the key of the box - 
room <unk> .' " he often had a <unk> way of talking , so that i thought little of what 
he said . he followed me to my room , however , that night with a very <unk> face . 
"' look here , <unk> ,' said he with his eyes <unk> down , ' can you let me have 
<unk> pounds ?' "' no , i <unk> !' i answered <unk> . ' i have been far too <unk> 
with you in money matters .' "' you have been very kind ,' said he , ' but i must 
have this money , or else i can never show my face inside the <unk> again .' "' and a 
very good thing , too !' i cried . "' yes , but you would not have me leave it 
a <unk> man ,' said he . ' i could not bear the <unk> . i must raise the money 
in some way , and if you will not let me have it , then i must <unk> other means 
.' " i was very <unk> , for this was the <unk> <unk> during the <unk> . ' you shall 
not have a <unk> from me ,' i cried , on which he <unk> and left the room without another 
word . " when he was gone i <unk> my <unk> , made sure that my <unk> was safe , 
and <unk> it again . then i started to go round the house to see that all was secure -- 
a <unk> which i <unk> leave to mary but which i thought it well to <unk> myself that night . 
as i came down the stairs i saw mary herself at the side window of the hall , which she 
<unk> and <unk> as i <unk> . "' tell me , <unk> ,' said she , looking , i thought 
, a little <unk> , ' did you give <unk> , the maid , leave to go out to - 
night ?' "' certainly not .' "' she came in just now by the back door . i have no 
doubt that she has only been to the side <unk> to see someone , but i think that it is 
hardly safe and should be stopped .' "' you must speak to her in the morning , or i will 
if you prefer it . are you sure that <unk> is <unk> ?' "' quite sure , <unk> .' "' 
then , good - night .' i <unk> her and went up to my bedroom again , where i was 
soon <unk> . " i am endeavouring to tell you <unk> , mr . holmes , which may have any 
<unk> upon the case , but i <unk> that you will question me upon any point which i do not 
make clear ." " on the contrary , your <unk> is <unk> <unk> ." " i come to a part 
of my story now in which i should wish to be particularly so . i am not a very heavy 
<unk> , and the anxiety in my mind <unk> , no doubt , to make me even less so than 
usual . about two in the morning , then , i was <unk> by some sound in the house . 
it had ceased <unk> i was <unk> <unk> , but it had left an impression behind it as though a 
window had <unk> <unk> <unk> . i lay <unk> with all my <unk> . suddenly , to my <unk> , 
there was a <unk> sound of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the next room . i <unk> out of <unk> , 
all <unk> with fear , and <unk> round the corner of my <unk> - room door . "' arthur !' 
i <unk> , ' you <unk> ! you <unk> ! how <unk> you <unk> that coronet ?' " the <unk> 
was half up , as i had left it , and my <unk> boy , dressed only in his <unk> 
and trousers , was standing beside the light , <unk> the coronet in his hands . he appeared to be 
<unk> at it , or <unk> it with all his <unk> . at my cry he dropped it from his 
grasp and turned as <unk> as death . i <unk> it up and examined it . one of the gold 
<unk> , with three of the <unk> in it , was <unk> . "' you <unk> !' i shouted , 
beside myself with <unk> . ' you have <unk> it ! you have <unk> me <unk> ! where are the 
<unk> which you have stolen ?' "' stolen !' he cried . "' yes , <unk> !' i <unk> , 
<unk> him by the shoulder . "' there are none <unk> . there <unk> be any <unk> ,' said he 
. "' there are three <unk> . and you know where they are . must i call you a <unk> 
as well as a <unk> ? did i not see you <unk> to <unk> off another <unk> ?' "' you 
have called me <unk> enough ,' said he , ' i will not <unk> it any <unk> . i shall 
not say another word about this business , since you have <unk> to <unk> me . i will leave your 
house in the morning and make my own way in the world .' "' you shall leave it in the 
hands of the police !' i cried half - mad with <unk> and <unk> . ' i shall have this 
matter <unk> to the <unk> .' "' you shall <unk> nothing from me ,' said he with a <unk> such 
as i should not have thought was in his nature . ' if you <unk> to call the police , 
let the police find what they can .' " by this time the whole house was <unk> , for i 
had raised my voice in my <unk> . mary was the first to rush into my room , and , 
at the <unk> of the coronet and of arthur ' s face , she read the whole story and , 
with a <unk> , fell down <unk> on the ground . i sent the house - maid for the police 
and put the investigation into their hands at once . when the <unk> and a <unk> entered the house , 
arthur , who had stood <unk> with his arms <unk> , asked me whether it was my intention to <unk> 
him with <unk> . i answered that it had ceased to be a private matter , but had <unk> a 
<unk> one , since the <unk> coronet was <unk> <unk> . i was determined that the law should have its 
way in <unk> . "' at least ,' said he , ' you will not have me <unk> at once 
. it would be to your advantage as well as mine if i might leave the house for five minutes 
.' "' that you may get away , or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen ,' said 
i . and then , <unk> the dreadful position in which i was placed , i <unk> him to remember 
that not only my honour but that of one who was far <unk> than i was at <unk> ; and 
that he <unk> to raise a scandal which would <unk> the <unk> . he might <unk> it all if he 
would but tell me what he had done with the three <unk> <unk> . "' you may as well face 
the matter ,' said i ; ' you have been caught in the <unk> , and no <unk> could make 
your <unk> more <unk> . if you but make such <unk> as is in your power , by <unk> us 
where the <unk> are , all shall be <unk> and <unk> .' "' keep your <unk> for those who <unk> 
for it ,' he answered , <unk> away from me with a sneer . i saw that he was too 
hardened for any <unk> of mine to influence him . there was but one way for it . i called 
in the <unk> and gave him into <unk> . a search was made at once not only of his person 
but of his room and of every <unk> of the house where he could <unk> have <unk> the <unk> ; 
but no <unk> of them could be found , nor would the <unk> boy open his mouth for all our 
<unk> and our <unk> . this morning he was <unk> to a <unk> , and i , after <unk> through 
all the police <unk> , have hurried round to you to <unk> you to use your <unk> in <unk> the 
matter . the police have <unk> <unk> that they can at present make nothing of it . you may go 
to any <unk> which you think <unk> . i have already <unk> a reward of <unk> pounds . my god 
, what shall i do ! i have lost my honour , my <unk> , and my <unk> in one 
night . oh , what shall i do !" he put a hand on either side of his head and 
<unk> himself to and fro , <unk> to himself like a child whose <unk> has got beyond <unk> . sherlock 
holmes sat <unk> for some few minutes , with his <unk> <unk> and his eyes <unk> upon the fire . 
" do you <unk> much company ?" he asked . " none save my <unk> with his family and an 
<unk> friend of arthur ' s . sir <unk> <unk> has been several times lately . no one else , 
i think ." " do you go out much in society ?" " arthur does . mary and i stay 
at home . we neither of us care for it ." " that is unusual in a young girl ." 
" she is of a quiet nature . besides , she is not so very young . she is four 
- and - twenty ." " this matter , from what you say , seems to have been a <unk> 
to her also ." " <unk> ! she is even more <unk> than i ." " you have neither of 
you any doubt as to your <unk> ' s <unk> ?" " how can we have when i saw him 
with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands ." " i hardly <unk> that a <unk> <unk> . 
was the <unk> of the coronet at all injured ?" " yes , it was twisted ." " do you 
not think , then , that he might have been <unk> to <unk> it ?" " god <unk> you ! 
you are doing what you can for him and for me . but it is too heavy a task . 
what was he doing there at all ? if his purpose were <unk> , why did he not say so 
?" " precisely . and if it were <unk> , why did he not <unk> a lie ? his silence 
appears to me to <unk> both <unk> . there are several singular <unk> about the case . what did the 
police think of the <unk> which <unk> you from your <unk> ?" " they <unk> that it might be caused 
by arthur ' s closing his bedroom door ." " a likely story ! as if a man <unk> on 
<unk> would <unk> his door so as to <unk> a <unk> . what did they say , then , of 
the <unk> of these <unk> ?" " they are still <unk> the <unk> and <unk> the furniture in the hope 
of <unk> them ." " have they thought of looking outside the house ?" " yes , they have shown 
extraordinary energy . the whole garden has already been <unk> examined ." " now , my dear sir ," said 
holmes , " is it not <unk> to you now that this matter really strikes very much <unk> than either 
you or the police were at first inclined to think ? it appeared to you to be a simple case 
; to me it seems <unk> <unk> . <unk> what is <unk> by your <unk> . you suppose that your 
<unk> came down from his <unk> , went , at great <unk> , to your <unk> - room , opened 
your <unk> , took out your coronet , broke off by <unk> <unk> a small <unk> of it , went 
off to some other <unk> , <unk> three <unk> out of the thirty - <unk> , with such <unk> that 
<unk> can find them , and then returned with the other thirty - six into the room in which he 
<unk> himself to the <unk> <unk> of being <unk> . i <unk> you now , is such a <unk> <unk> 
?" " but what other is there ?" cried the banker with a gesture of <unk> . " if his 
motives were <unk> , why does he not explain them ?" " it is our task to find that out 
," <unk> holmes ; " so now , if you please , mr . <unk> , we will <unk> off 
for <unk> together , and <unk> an hour to glancing a little more closely into details ." my friend <unk> 
upon my <unk> them in their <unk> , which i was <unk> enough to do , for my curiosity and 
sympathy were deeply <unk> by the story to which we had listened . i confess that the <unk> of the 
banker ' s <unk> appeared to me to be as <unk> as it did to his <unk> <unk> , but 
still i had such <unk> in holmes ' <unk> that i felt that there must be some <unk> for hope 
as long as he was <unk> with the <unk> <unk> . he hardly spoke a word the whole way out 
to the <unk> <unk> , but sat with his chin upon his <unk> and his hat drawn over his eyes 
, sunk in the deepest thought . our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of 
hope which had been <unk> to him , and he even broke into a <unk> chat with me over his 
business affairs . a <unk> <unk> journey and a <unk> walk brought us to <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of 
the great <unk> . <unk> was a good - <unk> <unk> house of white <unk> , standing back a little 
from the road . a double carriage - <unk> , with a <unk> - <unk> <unk> , stretched down in 
front to two large <unk> <unk> which <unk> the <unk> . on the right side was a small <unk> <unk> 
, which led into a <unk> <unk> between two neat <unk> <unk> from the road to the <unk> door , 
and <unk> the <unk> ' s <unk> . on the left ran a lane which led to the <unk> , 
and was not itself within the <unk> at all , being a <unk> , though little <unk> , <unk> . 
holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house , across the front , down 
the <unk> ' s <unk> , and so round by the garden behind into the <unk> lane . so long 
was he that mr . <unk> and i went into the <unk> - room and waited by the fire until 
he should return . we were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in 
. she was rather above the <unk> height , slim , with dark <unk> and eyes , which seemed the 
<unk> against the absolute <unk> of her <unk> . i do not think that i have ever seen such <unk> 
<unk> in a woman ' s face . her <unk> , too , were <unk> , but her eyes were 
flushed with <unk> . as she <unk> <unk> into the room she <unk> me with a <unk> <unk> of <unk> 
than the banker had done in the morning , and it was the more <unk> in her as she was 
evidently a woman of strong character , with immense <unk> for self - <unk> . <unk> my <unk> , she 
went straight to her <unk> and passed her hand over his head with a <unk> <unk> <unk> . " you 
have given orders that arthur should be <unk> , have you not , <unk> ?" she asked . " no 
, no , my girl , the matter must be <unk> to the <unk> ." " but i am so 
sure that he is <unk> . you know what woman ' s <unk> are . i know that he has 
done no <unk> and that you will be sorry for having <unk> so <unk> ." " why is he <unk> 
, then , if he is <unk> ?" " who knows ? perhaps because he was so <unk> that you 
should <unk> him ." " how could i help <unk> him , when i <unk> saw him with the coronet 
in his hand ?" " oh , but he had only <unk> it up to look at it . oh 
, do , do take my word for it that he is <unk> . let the matter drop and say 
no more . it is so dreadful to think of our dear arthur in <unk> !" " i shall never 
let it drop until the <unk> are found -- never , mary ! your <unk> for arthur blinds you as 
to the <unk> <unk> to me . far from <unk> the thing up , i have brought a gentleman down 
from london to <unk> more deeply into it ." " this gentleman ?" she asked , <unk> round to me 
. " no , his friend . he wished us to leave him alone . he is round in the 
<unk> lane now ." " the <unk> lane ?" she raised her dark <unk> . " what can he hope 
to find there ? ah ! this , i suppose , is he . i trust , sir , that 
you will <unk> in <unk> , what i <unk> sure is the <unk> , that my <unk> arthur is <unk> 
of this crime ." " i <unk> <unk> your <unk> , and i trust , with you , that we 
may prove it ," returned holmes , <unk> back to the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> from his <unk> . 
" i believe i have the honour of addressing miss mary <unk> . might i <unk> you a question or 
two ?" " pray do , sir , if it may help to clear this <unk> <unk> up ." " 
you heard nothing yourself last night ?" " nothing , until my <unk> here began to speak <unk> . i 
heard that , and i came down ." " you <unk> up the windows and <unk> the night before . 
did you <unk> all the windows ?" " yes ." " were they all <unk> this morning ?" " yes 
." " you have a maid who has a <unk> ? i think that you remarked to your <unk> last 
night that she had been out to see him ?" " yes , and she was the girl who waited 
in the drawing - room , and who may have heard <unk> ' s <unk> about the coronet ." " 
i see . you <unk> that she may have gone out to tell her <unk> , and that the two 
may have <unk> the <unk> ." " but what is the good of all these vague theories ," cried the 
banker impatiently , " when i have told you that i saw arthur with the coronet in his hands ?" 
" wait a little , mr . <unk> . we must come back to that . about this girl , 
miss <unk> . you saw her return by the <unk> door , i <unk> ?" " yes ; when i 
went to see if the door was <unk> for the night i <unk> her slipping in . i saw the 
man , too , in the <unk> ." " do you know him ?" " oh , yes ! he 
is the <unk> - <unk> who <unk> our <unk> round . his name is <unk> <unk> ." " he stood 
," said holmes , " to the left of the door -- that is to say , <unk> up the 
<unk> than is <unk> to reach the door ?" " yes , he did ." " and he is a 
man with a <unk> <unk> ?" something like fear sprang up in the young lady ' s <unk> black eyes 
. " why , you are like a <unk> ," said she . " how do you know that ?" 
she <unk> , but there was no <unk> smile in holmes ' <unk> , <unk> face . " i should 
be very glad now to go <unk> ," said he . " i shall probably wish to go over the 
outside of the house again . perhaps i had better take a look at the lower windows before i go 
up ." he walked swiftly round from one to the other , <unk> only at the large one which looked 
from the hall <unk> the <unk> lane . this he opened and made a very <unk> <unk> of the <unk> 
with his <unk> <unk> <unk> . " now we shall go <unk> ," said he at last . the banker 
' s <unk> - room was a plainly furnished little chamber , with a <unk> <unk> , a large <unk> 
, and a long <unk> . holmes went to the <unk> first and looked hard at the lock . " 
which key was <unk> to open it ?" he asked . " that which my <unk> himself indicated -- that 
of the <unk> of the <unk> - room ." " have you it here ?" " that is it on 
the <unk> - table ." sherlock holmes took it up and opened the <unk> . " it is a <unk> 
lock ," said he . " it is no wonder that it did not <unk> you . this case , 
i <unk> , <unk> the coronet . we must have a look at it ." he opened the case , 
and taking out the <unk> he laid it upon the table . it was a <unk> specimen of the <unk> 
' s <unk> , and the thirty - six <unk> were the <unk> that i have ever seen . at 
one side of the coronet was a <unk> <unk> , where a corner <unk> three <unk> had been <unk> away 
. " now , mr . <unk> ," said holmes , " here is the corner which <unk> to that 
which has been so <unk> lost . might i <unk> that you will <unk> it off ." the banker <unk> 
in <unk> . " i should not <unk> of <unk> ," said he . " then i will ." holmes 
suddenly <unk> his <unk> upon it , but without result . " i <unk> it give a little ," said 
he ; " but , though i am <unk> strong in the <unk> , it would take me all my 
time to <unk> it . an ordinary man could not do it . now , what do you think would 
<unk> if i did <unk> it , mr . <unk> ? there would be a <unk> like a <unk> shot 
. do you tell me that all this <unk> within a few <unk> of your <unk> and that you heard 
nothing of it ?" " i do not know what to think . it is all dark to me ." 
" but perhaps it may grow <unk> as we go . what do you think , miss <unk> ?" " 
i confess that i still <unk> my <unk> ' s <unk> ." " your <unk> had no <unk> or <unk> 
on when you saw him ?" " he had nothing on save only his trousers and <unk> ." " thank 
you . we have certainly been <unk> with extraordinary <unk> during this inquiry , and it will be entirely our 
own <unk> if we do not <unk> in clearing the matter up . with your <unk> , mr . <unk> 
, i shall now continue my <unk> outside ." he went alone , at his own <unk> , for he 
explained that any <unk> <unk> might make his task more difficult . for an hour or more he was at 
work , returning at last with his feet heavy with <unk> and his features as <unk> as ever . " 
i think that i have seen now all that there is to see , mr . <unk> ," said he 
; " i can <unk> you best by returning to my rooms ." " but the <unk> , mr . 
holmes . where are they ?" " i <unk> tell ." the banker <unk> his hands . " i shall 
never see them again !" he cried . " and my <unk> ? you give me hopes ?" " my 
<unk> is in no way <unk> ." " then , for god ' s <unk> , what was this dark 
business which was <unk> in my house last night ?" " if you can call upon me at my baker 
street rooms to - morrow morning between <unk> and ten i shall be <unk> to do what i can to 
make it <unk> . i understand that you give me carte blanche to <unk> for you , provided only that 
i get back the <unk> , and that you <unk> no <unk> on the <unk> i may draw ." " 
i would give my <unk> to have them back ." " very good . i shall look into the matter 
between this and then . good - <unk> ; it is just <unk> that i may have to come over 
here again before evening ." it was <unk> to me that my companion ' s mind was now made up 
about the case , <unk> what his <unk> were was more than i could even dimly imagine . several times 
during our <unk> journey i <unk> to sound him upon the point , but he always <unk> away to some 
other <unk> , until at last i gave it over in <unk> . it was not yet three when we 
found ourselves in our rooms once more . he hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few 
minutes dressed as a <unk> loafer . with his <unk> turned up , his <unk> , <unk> coat , his 
red <unk> , and his <unk> boots , he was a perfect <unk> of the <unk> . " i think 
that this should do ," said he , glancing into the glass above the <unk> . " i only wish 
that you could come with me , watson , but i fear that it won ' t do . i 
may be on the <unk> in this matter , or i may be following a will - o <unk> the 
- <unk> , but i shall soon know which it is . i hope that i may be back in 
a few hours ." he <unk> a <unk> of beef from the <unk> upon the <unk> , sandwiched it between 
two <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> this <unk> <unk> into his pocket he started off upon his <unk> . 
i had just finished my <unk> when he returned , evidently in excellent <unk> , <unk> an old <unk> - 
<unk> boot in his hand . he <unk> it down into a corner and <unk> himself to a <unk> of 
<unk> . " i only looked in as i passed ," said he . " i am <unk> right on 
." " where to ?" " oh , to the other side of the <unk> end . it may be 
some time before i get back . don ' t wait up for me in case i should be late 
." " how are you getting on ?" " oh , so so . nothing to <unk> of . i 
have been out to <unk> since i saw you last , but i did not call at the house . 
it is a very <unk> little problem , and i would not have <unk> it for a good deal . 
however , i must not sit <unk> here , but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my 
<unk> respectable self ." i could see by his manner that he had <unk> reasons for satisfaction than his <unk> 
alone would <unk> . his eyes <unk> , and there was even a <unk> of <unk> upon his <unk> <unk> 
. he <unk> <unk> , and a few minutes later i heard the <unk> of the hall door , which 
told me that he was off once more upon his <unk> <unk> . i waited until midnight , but there 
was no sign of his return , so i retired to my room . it was no <unk> thing for 
him to be away for days and <unk> on end when he was hot upon a scent , so that 
his <unk> caused me no surprise . i do not know at what hour he came in , but when 
i came down to <unk> in the morning there he was with a <unk> of coffee in one hand and 
the paper in the other , as fresh and <unk> as <unk> . " you will excuse my <unk> without 
you , watson ," said he , " but you remember that our client has rather an <unk> <unk> this 
morning ." " why , it is after <unk> now ," i answered . " i should not be <unk> 
if that were he . i thought i heard a ring ." it was , indeed , our friend the 
<unk> . i was <unk> by the change which had come over him , for his face which was naturally 
of a broad and <unk> <unk> , was now <unk> and <unk> in , while his <unk> seemed to me 
at least a <unk> <unk> . he entered with a <unk> and <unk> which was even more <unk> than his 
<unk> of the morning before , and he dropped <unk> into the armchair which i pushed forward for him . 
" i do not know what i have done to be so <unk> tried ," said he . " only 
two days ago i was a <unk> and <unk> man , without a care in the world . now i 
am left to a <unk> and <unk> <unk> . one <unk> comes close upon the heels of another . my 
<unk> , mary , has <unk> me ." " <unk> you ?" " yes . her <unk> this morning had 
not been slept in , her room was empty , and a note for me lay upon the hall table 
. i had said to her last night , in <unk> and not in <unk> , that if she had 
married my boy all might have been well with him . perhaps it was <unk> of me to say so 
. it is to that <unk> that she <unk> in this note : "' my <unk> <unk> <unk> i <unk> 
that i have brought <unk> upon you , and that if i had <unk> <unk> this <unk> <unk> might never 
have <unk> . i <unk> , with this thought in my mind , ever again be <unk> under your <unk> 
, and i <unk> that i must leave you <unk> . do not <unk> about my future , for that 
is provided for ; and , above all , do not search for me , for it will be <unk> 
<unk> and an ill - <unk> to me . in life or in death , i am ever your <unk> 
,-- mary .' " what could she mean by that note , mr . holmes ? do you think it 
<unk> to <unk> ?" " no , no , nothing of the kind . it is perhaps the best <unk> 
<unk> . i trust , mr . <unk> , that you are <unk> the end of your <unk> ." " 
ha ! you say so ! you have heard something , mr . holmes ; you have <unk> something ! 
where are the <unk> ?" " you would not think <unk> pounds apiece an <unk> <unk> for them ?" " 
i would pay ten ." " that would be <unk> . three <unk> will <unk> the matter . and there 
is a little reward , i fancy . have you your <unk> - book ? here is a <unk> . 
better make it out for <unk> pounds ." with a <unk> face the banker made out the <unk> <unk> . 
holmes walked over to his <unk> , took out a little <unk> <unk> of gold with three <unk> in it 
, and threw it down upon the table . with a shriek of <unk> our client <unk> it up . 
" you have it !" he <unk> . " i am saved ! i am saved !" the <unk> of 
<unk> was as <unk> as his <unk> had been , and he <unk> his recovered <unk> to his <unk> . 
" there is one other thing you <unk> , mr . <unk> ," said sherlock holmes rather <unk> . " 
<unk> !" he caught up a <unk> . " name the <unk> , and i will pay it ." " 
no , the <unk> is not to me . you <unk> a very <unk> <unk> to that noble <unk> , 
your <unk> , who has carried himself in this matter as i should be <unk> to see my own <unk> 
do , should i ever chance to have one ." " then it was not arthur who took them ?" 
" i told you yesterday , and i <unk> to - day , that it was not ." " you 
are sure of it ! then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the <unk> 
is known ." " he knows it already . when i had <unk> it all up i had an <unk> 
with him , and <unk> that he would not tell me the story , i told it to him , 
on which he had to confess that i was right and to <unk> the very few details which were not 
yet quite clear to me . your news of this morning , however , may open his <unk> ." " 
for <unk> ' s <unk> , tell me , then , what is this extraordinary mystery !" " i will 
do so , and i will show you the steps by which i reached it . and let me say 
to you , first , that which it is <unk> for me to say and for you to hear : 
there has been an <unk> between sir <unk> <unk> and your <unk> mary . they have now <unk> together ." 
" my mary ? <unk> !" " it is <unk> more than <unk> ; it is certain . neither you 
nor your <unk> knew the true character of this man when you <unk> him into your family <unk> . he 
is one of the most <unk> men in england -- a <unk> <unk> , an absolutely <unk> <unk> , a 
man without heart or <unk> . your <unk> knew nothing of such men . when he <unk> his <unk> to 
her , as he had done to a hundred before her , she <unk> herself that she alone had <unk> 
his heart . the devil knows best what he said , but at least she became his <unk> and was 
in the habit of <unk> him nearly every evening ." " i <unk> , and i will not , believe 
it !" cried the banker with an <unk> face . " i will tell you , then , what <unk> 
in your house last night . your <unk> , when you had , as she thought , gone to your 
room , <unk> down and <unk> to her lover through the window which <unk> into the <unk> lane . his 
<unk> had <unk> right through the <unk> , so long had he stood there . she told him of the 
coronet . his <unk> <unk> for gold <unk> at the news , and he <unk> her to his will . 
i have no doubt that she loved you , but there are women in whom the love of a lover 
<unk> all other loves , and i think that she must have been one . she had hardly listened to 
his <unk> when she saw you coming <unk> , on which she <unk> the window <unk> and told you about 
one of the <unk> ' <unk> with her <unk> - <unk> lover , which was all perfectly true . " 
your boy , arthur , went to <unk> after his <unk> with you but he slept <unk> on account of 
his <unk> about his <unk> <unk> . in the <unk> of the night he heard a <unk> <unk> pass his 
door , so he rose and , looking out , was <unk> to see his <unk> walking very <unk> <unk> 
the passage until she disappeared into your <unk> - room . <unk> with <unk> , the <unk> <unk> on some 
clothes and waited there in the dark to see what would come of this strange <unk> . presently she emerged 
from the room again , and in the light of the passage - <unk> your <unk> saw that she carried 
the precious coronet in her hands . she passed down the stairs , and he , <unk> with <unk> , 
ran <unk> and <unk> behind the <unk> near your door , whence he could see what passed in the hall 
<unk> . he saw her <unk> open the window , hand out the coronet to someone in the <unk> , 
and then closing it once more hurry back to her room , passing quite close to where he stood <unk> 
behind the <unk> . " as long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without 
a <unk> <unk> of the woman whom he loved . but the instant that she was gone he <unk> how 
<unk> a <unk> this would be for you , and how all - important it was to <unk> it right 
. he rushed down , just as he was , in his <unk> feet , opened the window , sprang 
out into the <unk> , and ran down the lane , where he could see a dark figure in the 
<unk> . sir <unk> <unk> tried to get away , but arthur caught him , and there was a <unk> 
between them , your <unk> <unk> at one side of the coronet , and his <unk> at the other . 
in the scuffle , your <unk> struck sir <unk> and <unk> him over the eye . then something suddenly <unk> 
, and your <unk> , <unk> that he had the coronet in his hands , rushed back , <unk> the 
window , <unk> to your room , and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the <unk> 
and was endeavouring to <unk> it when you appeared upon the scene ." " is it <unk> ?" <unk> the 
banker . " you then <unk> his <unk> by <unk> him <unk> at a moment when he felt that he 
had <unk> your <unk> <unk> . he could not explain the true state of affairs without <unk> one who certainly 
<unk> little enough <unk> at his hands . he took the more <unk> view , however , and <unk> her 
secret ." " and that was why she <unk> and <unk> when she saw the coronet ," cried mr . 
<unk> . " oh , my god ! what a blind <unk> i have been ! and his <unk> to 
be <unk> to go out for five minutes ! the dear fellow wanted to see if the <unk> <unk> were 
at the scene of the <unk> . how cruelly i have <unk> him !" " when i arrived at the 
house ," continued holmes , " i at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any 
<unk> in the <unk> which might help me . i knew that none had <unk> since the evening before , 
and also that there had been a strong <unk> to preserve <unk> . i passed <unk> the <unk> ' s 
<unk> , but found it all <unk> down and <unk> . just beyond it , however , at the far 
side of the <unk> door , a woman had stood and <unk> with a man , whose round <unk> on 
one side showed that he had a <unk> <unk> . i could even tell that they had been <unk> , 
for the woman had run back swiftly to the door , as was shown by the deep <unk> and light 
<unk> <unk> , while <unk> - <unk> had waited a little , and then had gone away . i thought 
at the time that this might be the maid and her <unk> , of whom you had already spoken to 
me , and inquiry showed it was so . i passed round the garden without <unk> anything more than <unk> 
<unk> , which i took to be the police ; but when i got into the <unk> lane a very 
long and <unk> story was written in the <unk> in front of me . " there was a double line 
of <unk> of a <unk> man , and a second double line which i saw with <unk> <unk> to a 
man with <unk> feet . i was at once <unk> from what you had told me that the latter was 
your <unk> . the first had walked both <unk> , but the other had run swiftly , and as his 
<unk> was marked in <unk> over the <unk> of the boot , it was <unk> that he had passed after 
the other . i followed them up and found they led to the hall window , where boots had <unk> 
all the <unk> away while waiting . then i walked to the other end , which was a hundred <unk> 
or more down the lane . i saw where boots had faced round , where the <unk> was <unk> up 
as though there had been a <unk> , and , finally , where a few <unk> of blood had <unk> 
, to show me that i was not mistaken . boots had then run down the lane , and another 
little <unk> of blood showed that it was he who had been hurt . when he came to the <unk> 
at the other end , i found that the pavement had been <unk> , so there was an end to 
that <unk> . " on <unk> the house , however , i examined , as you remember , the <unk> 
and <unk> of the hall window with my <unk> , and i could at once see that someone had passed 
out . i could <unk> the <unk> of an <unk> where the wet <unk> had been placed in coming in 
. i was then <unk> to be able to form an <unk> as to what had <unk> . a man 
had waited outside the window ; someone had brought the <unk> ; the <unk> had been <unk> by your <unk> 
; he had pursued the <unk> ; had <unk> with him ; they had each <unk> at the coronet , 
their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which neither alone could have <unk> . he had returned with the <unk> , but 
had left a <unk> in the grasp of his <unk> . so far i was clear . the question now 
was , who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet ? " it is an old 
<unk> of mine that when you have <unk> the <unk> , whatever remains , however <unk> , must be the 
<unk> . now , i knew that it was not you who had brought it down , so there only 
remained your <unk> and the maids . but if it were the maids , why should your <unk> <unk> himself 
to be <unk> in their <unk> ? there could be no <unk> reason . as he loved his <unk> , 
however , there was an excellent <unk> why he should <unk> her secret -- the more so as the secret 
was a <unk> one . when i remembered that you had seen her at that window , and how she 
had <unk> on <unk> the coronet again , my <unk> became a <unk> . " and who could it be 
who was her <unk> ? a lover evidently , for who else could <unk> the love and <unk> which she 
must <unk> to you ? i knew that you went out little , and that your <unk> of <unk> was 
a very <unk> one . but among them was sir <unk> <unk> . i had heard of him before as 
being a man of evil <unk> among women . it must have been he who wore those boots and <unk> 
the <unk> <unk> . even though he knew that arthur had <unk> him , he might still <unk> himself that 
he was safe , for the <unk> could not say a word without compromising his own family . " well 
, your own good <unk> will <unk> what measures i took next . i went in the <unk> of a 
loafer to sir <unk> ' s house , <unk> to <unk> up an acquaintance with his <unk> , <unk> that 
his master had <unk> his head the night before , and , finally , at the <unk> of six <unk> 
, made all sure by <unk> a pair of his <unk> - off <unk> . with these i <unk> down 
to <unk> and saw that they exactly fitted the <unk> ." " i saw an ill - dressed <unk> in 
the lane yesterday evening ," said mr . <unk> . " precisely . it was i . i found that 
i had my man , so i came home and changed my clothes . it was a delicate part which 
i had to play then , for i saw that a <unk> must be <unk> to <unk> scandal , and 
i knew that so <unk> a <unk> would see that our hands were <unk> in the matter . i went 
and saw him . at first , of course , he <unk> <unk> . but when i gave him every 
<unk> that had <unk> , he tried to <unk> and took down a life - <unk> from the wall . 
i knew my man , however , and i clapped a <unk> to his head before he could <unk> . 
then he became a little more <unk> . i told him that we would give him a <unk> for the 
<unk> he <unk> -- <unk> pounds apiece . that brought out the first signs of <unk> that he had shown 
. ' why , <unk> it all !' said he , ' i ' ve let them go at six 
hundred for the three !' i soon <unk> to get the address of the <unk> who had them , on 
<unk> him that there would be no <unk> . off i <unk> to him , and after much <unk> i 
got our <unk> at <unk> pounds apiece . then i looked in upon your <unk> , told him that all 
was right , and <unk> got to my <unk> about two o ' clock , after what i may call 
a really hard day ' s work ." " a day which has saved england from a great <unk> scandal 
," said the banker , <unk> . " sir , i <unk> find <unk> to thank you , but you 
shall not find me <unk> for what you have done . your <unk> has indeed <unk> all that i have 
heard of it . and now i must <unk> to my dear boy to <unk> to him for the <unk> 
which i have done him . as to what you tell me of poor mary , it goes to my 
very heart . not even your <unk> can <unk> me where she is now ." " i think that we 
may safely say ," returned holmes , " that she is <unk> sir <unk> <unk> is . it is equally 
certain , too , that whatever her <unk> are , they will soon <unk> a more than sufficient <unk> ." 
xii . the adventure of the copper beeches " to the man who loves <unk> for its own <unk> ," 
remarked sherlock holmes , <unk> <unk> the <unk> sheet of the daily <unk> , " it is frequently in its 
least important and <unk> <unk> that the <unk> pleasure is to be <unk> . it is <unk> to me to 
observe , watson , that you have so far <unk> this <unk> that in these little <unk> of our cases 
which you have been good enough to draw up , and , i am bound to say , occasionally to 
<unk> , you have given <unk> not so much to the many <unk> <unk> © <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
<unk> in which i have <unk> but rather to those incidents which may have been <unk> in <unk> , but 
which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of <unk> <unk> which i have made my <unk> <unk> 
." " and yet ," said i , <unk> , " i <unk> quite hold myself <unk> from the <unk> 
of <unk> which has been <unk> against my <unk> ." " you have <unk> , perhaps ," he observed , 
taking up a <unk> <unk> with the <unk> and lighting with it the long <unk> - wood <unk> which was 
<unk> to <unk> his <unk> when he was in a <unk> rather than a <unk> mood --" you have <unk> 
perhaps in <unk> to put <unk> and life into each of your <unk> instead of <unk> yourself to the task 
of <unk> upon <unk> that <unk> reasoning from cause to <unk> which is really the only <unk> <unk> about the 
thing ." " it seems to me that i have done you <unk> <unk> in the matter ," i remarked 
with some <unk> , for i was <unk> by the <unk> which i had more than once observed to be 
a strong factor in my friend ' s singular character . " no , it is not <unk> or <unk> 
," said he , <unk> , as was his <unk> , my <unk> rather than my <unk> . " if 
i <unk> <unk> <unk> for my <unk> , it is because it is an <unk> thing -- a thing beyond 
myself . crime is <unk> . <unk> is <unk> . therefore it is upon the <unk> rather than upon the 
crime that you should <unk> . you have <unk> what should have been a course of <unk> into a <unk> 
of <unk> ." it was a cold morning of the <unk> <unk> , and we sat after <unk> on either 
side of a <unk> fire in the old room at baker street . a thick <unk> rolled down between the 
<unk> of <unk> - coloured houses , and the <unk> windows <unk> like dark , <unk> <unk> through the heavy 
<unk> <unk> . our <unk> was lit and <unk> on the white <unk> and <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , 
for the table had not been <unk> yet . sherlock holmes had been <unk> all the morning , <unk> <unk> 
into the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> of papers until at last , having apparently given up his search , 
he had emerged in no very <unk> <unk> to <unk> me upon my <unk> <unk> . " at the same 
time ," he remarked after a <unk> , during which he had sat <unk> at his long <unk> and <unk> 
down into the fire , " you can hardly be open to a <unk> of <unk> , for out of 
these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself in , a <unk> <unk> do not <unk> 
of crime , in its legal <unk> , at all . the small matter in which i <unk> to help 
the king of bohemia , the singular <unk> of miss mary <unk> , the problem <unk> with the man with 
the twisted lip , and the <unk> of the noble bachelor , were all matters which are outside the <unk> 
of the law . but in <unk> the <unk> , i fear that you may have <unk> on the <unk> 
." " the end may have been so ," i answered , " but the methods i hold to have 
been <unk> and of interest ." " pshaw , my dear fellow , what do the <unk> , the great 
<unk> <unk> , who could hardly tell a <unk> by his <unk> or a <unk> by his left thumb , 
care about the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and deduction ! but , indeed , if you are <unk> , i 
<unk> <unk> you , for the days of the great cases are past . man , or at least <unk> 
man , has lost all <unk> and <unk> . as to my own little practice , it seems to be 
<unk> into an <unk> for <unk> lost lead <unk> and <unk> <unk> to young <unk> from <unk> - <unk> . 
i think that i have <unk> <unk> at last , however . this note i had this morning <unk> my 
<unk> - point , i fancy . read it !" he tossed a <unk> letter across to me . it 
was dated from <unk> <unk> upon the preceding evening , and ran <unk> : " dear mr . holmes <unk> 
i am very <unk> to consult you as to whether i should or should not <unk> a situation which has 
been <unk> to me as <unk> . i shall call at half - past ten to - morrow if i 
do not <unk> you . yours <unk> , " <unk> <unk> ." " do you know the young lady ?" 
i asked . " not i ." " it is half - past ten now ." " yes , and 
i have no doubt that is her ring ." " it may turn out to be of more interest than 
you think . you remember that the <unk> of the blue carbuncle , which appeared to be a <unk> <unk> 
at first , <unk> into a serious investigation . it may be so in this case , also ." " 
well , let us hope so . but our doubts will very soon be <unk> , for here , <unk> 
i am much mistaken , is the person in question ." as he spoke the door opened and a young 
lady entered the room . she was plainly but <unk> dressed , with a <unk> , quick face , <unk> 
like a <unk> ' s <unk> , and with the <unk> manner of a woman who has had her own 
way to make in the world . " you will excuse my <unk> you , i am sure ," said 
she , as my companion rose to <unk> her , " but i have had a very strange <unk> , 
and as i have no <unk> or <unk> of any sort from whom i could <unk> <unk> , i thought 
that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what i should do ." " pray take a seat 
, miss <unk> . i shall be <unk> to do anything that i can to <unk> you ." i could 
see that holmes was <unk> <unk> by the manner and <unk> of his new client . he looked her over 
in his searching fashion , and then <unk> himself , with his <unk> <unk> and his <unk> - <unk> together 
, to listen to her story . " i have been a <unk> for five years ," said she , 
" in the family of <unk> <unk> <unk> , but two months ago the <unk> received an <unk> at <unk> 
, in <unk> <unk> , and took his <unk> over to <unk> with him , so that i found myself 
without a situation . i <unk> , and i answered <unk> , but without success . at last the little 
money which i had saved began to run <unk> , and i was at my <unk> ' s end as 
to what i should do . " there is a well - known <unk> for <unk> in the <unk> end 
called <unk> ' s , and there i <unk> to call about once a week in order to see whether 
anything had turned up which might suit me . <unk> was the name of the <unk> of the business , 
but it is really <unk> by miss <unk> . she <unk> in her own little <unk> , and the <unk> 
who are <unk> <unk> wait in an <unk> , and are then shown in one by one , when she 
<unk> her <unk> and <unk> whether she has anything which would suit them . " well , when i called 
last week i was shown into the little <unk> as usual , but i found that miss <unk> was not 
alone . a <unk> <unk> man with a very <unk> face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in 
<unk> upon <unk> over his <unk> sat at her <unk> with a pair of <unk> on his <unk> , looking 
very earnestly at the <unk> who entered . as i came in he gave quite a <unk> in his chair 
and turned <unk> to miss <unk> . "' that will do ,' said he ; ' i could not <unk> 
for anything better . capital ! capital !' he seemed quite <unk> and rubbed his hands together in the most 
<unk> fashion . he was such a comfortable - looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at 
him . "' you are looking for a situation , miss ?' he asked . "' yes , sir .' 
"' as <unk> ?' "' yes , sir .' "' and what <unk> do you <unk> ?' "' i had 
<unk> pounds a <unk> in my last <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> .' "' oh , <unk> , <unk> ! 
<unk> -- <unk> <unk> !' he cried , throwing his <unk> hands out into the air like a man who 
is in a <unk> <unk> . ' how could anyone <unk> so <unk> a <unk> to a lady with such 
<unk> and <unk> ?' "' my <unk> , sir , may be less than you imagine ,' said i . 
' a little <unk> , a little german , <unk> , and drawing --' "' <unk> , <unk> !' he 
cried . ' this is all quite beside the question . the point is , have you or have you 
not the <unk> and <unk> of a lady ? there it is in a <unk> . if you have not 
, you are not fitted for the <unk> of a child who may some day play a <unk> part in 
the history of the country . but if you have why , then , how could any gentleman <unk> you 
to condescend to <unk> anything under the three figures ? your <unk> with me , <unk> , would <unk> at 
<unk> pounds a year .' " you may imagine , mr . holmes , that to me , <unk> as 
i was , such an <unk> seemed almost too good to be true . the gentleman , however , <unk> 
perhaps the look of <unk> upon my face , opened a pocket - book and took out a note . 
"' it is also my <unk> ,' said he , <unk> in the most <unk> fashion until his eyes were 
just two little <unk> <unk> <unk> the white <unk> of his face , ' to <unk> to my young <unk> 
half their <unk> <unk> , so that they may meet any little expenses of their journey and their <unk> .' 
" it seemed to me that i had never <unk> so <unk> and so <unk> a man . as i 
was already in <unk> to my <unk> , the <unk> was a great <unk> , and yet there was something 
<unk> about the whole <unk> which made me wish to know a little more before i quite committed myself . 
"' may i <unk> where you <unk> , sir ?' said i . "' <unk> . <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
the copper beeches , five <unk> on the far side of <unk> . it is the most lovely country , 
my dear young lady , and the <unk> old country - house .' "' and my <unk> , sir ? 
i should be glad to know what they would be .' "' one child -- one dear little <unk> just 
six years old . oh , if you could see him <unk> <unk> with a <unk> ! <unk> ! <unk> 
! <unk> ! three gone before you could <unk> !' he <unk> back in his chair and laughed his eyes 
into his head again . " i was a little startled at the nature of the child ' s <unk> 
, but the <unk> ' s <unk> made me think that perhaps he was <unk> . "' my sole <unk> 
, then ,' i asked , ' are to take <unk> of a single child ?' "' no , no 
, not the sole , not the sole , my dear young lady ,' he cried . ' your <unk> 
would be , as i am sure your good <unk> would <unk> , to <unk> any little <unk> my wife 
might give , provided always that they were such <unk> as a lady might with <unk> <unk> . you see 
no <unk> , <unk> ?' "' i should be <unk> to make myself <unk> .' "' quite so . in 
dress now , for example . we are <unk> people , you know -- <unk> but kind - <unk> . 
if you were asked to wear any dress which we might give you , you would not object to our 
little <unk> . <unk> ?' "' no ,' said i , <unk> <unk> at his <unk> . "' or to 
sit here , or sit there , that would not be <unk> to you ?' "' oh , no .' 
"' or to <unk> your <unk> quite <unk> before you come to us ?' " i could hardly believe my 
<unk> . as you may observe , mr . holmes , my <unk> is <unk> <unk> , and of a 
rather peculiar <unk> of <unk> . it has been <unk> <unk> . i could not <unk> of <unk> it in 
this <unk> fashion . "' i am <unk> that that is quite <unk> ,' said i . he had been 
watching me eagerly out of his small eyes , and i could see a shadow pass over his face as 
i spoke . "' i am <unk> that it is quite <unk> ,' said he . ' it is a 
little fancy of my wife ' s , and <unk> ' <unk> , you know , <unk> , <unk> ' 
<unk> must be <unk> . and so you won ' t <unk> your <unk> ?' "' no , sir , 
i really could not ,' i answered <unk> . "' ah , very well ; then that quite <unk> the 
matter . it is a pity , because in other <unk> you would really have done very nicely . in 
that case , miss <unk> , i had best <unk> a few more of your young <unk> .' " the 
<unk> had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us , but she 
glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that i could not help <unk> that she had 
lost a handsome <unk> through my <unk> . "' do you desire your name to be <unk> upon the books 
?' she asked . "' if you please , miss <unk> .' "' well , really , it seems rather 
<unk> , since you refuse the most excellent <unk> in this fashion ,' said she <unk> . ' you can 
hardly <unk> us to <unk> ourselves to find another such opening for you . good - day to you , 
miss <unk> .' she struck a <unk> upon the table , and i was shown out by the <unk> . 
" well , mr . holmes , when i got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the 
<unk> , and two or three <unk> upon the table , i began to <unk> myself whether i had not 
done a very <unk> thing . after all , if these people had strange <unk> and expected <unk> on the 
most extraordinary matters , they were at least <unk> to pay for their <unk> . very few <unk> in england 
are getting <unk> pounds a year . besides , what use was my <unk> to me ? many people are 
<unk> by wearing it <unk> and perhaps i should be among the number . next day i was inclined to 
think that i had made a mistake , and by the day after i was sure of it . i 
had almost <unk> my <unk> so far as to go back to the <unk> and <unk> whether the <unk> was 
still open when i received this letter from the gentleman himself . i have it here and i will read 
it to you : "' the copper beeches , near <unk> . "' dear miss <unk> <unk> miss <unk> has 
very kindly given me your address , and i <unk> from here to <unk> you whether you have <unk> your 
<unk> . my wife is very <unk> that you should come , for she has been much attracted by my 
description of you . we are <unk> to give <unk> pounds a quarter , or <unk> pounds a year , 
so as to <unk> you for any little <unk> which our <unk> may cause you . they are not very 
<unk> , after all . my wife is <unk> of a <unk> <unk> of <unk> blue and would like you 
to wear such a dress <unk> in the morning . you need not , however , go to the <unk> 
of <unk> one , as we have one <unk> to my dear daughter <unk> ( now in <unk> ), which 
would , i should think , <unk> you very well . then , as to sitting here or there , 
or <unk> yourself in any manner indicated , that need cause you no <unk> . as <unk> your <unk> , 
it is no doubt a pity , <unk> as i could not help <unk> its <unk> during our <unk> <unk> 
, but i am <unk> that i must remain <unk> upon this point , and i only hope that the 
increased <unk> may <unk> you for the <unk> . your <unk> , as far as the child is <unk> , 
are very light . now do <unk> to come , and i shall meet you with the <unk> - <unk> 
at <unk> . let me know your train . yours <unk> , <unk> <unk> .' " that is the letter 
which i have just received , mr . holmes , and my mind is made up that i will <unk> 
it . i thought , however , that before taking the <unk> step i should like to <unk> the whole 
matter to your <unk> ." " well , miss <unk> , if your mind is made up , that <unk> 
the question ," said holmes , <unk> . " but you would not advise me to refuse ?" " i 
confess that it is not the situation which i should like to see a <unk> of mine <unk> for ." 
" what is the <unk> of it all , mr . holmes ?" " ah , i have no data 
. i <unk> tell . perhaps you have yourself <unk> some <unk> ?" " well , there seems to me 
to be only one <unk> <unk> . mr . <unk> seemed to be a very kind , good - <unk> 
man . is it not <unk> that his wife is a <unk> , that he desires to keep the matter 
quiet for fear she should be taken to an <unk> , and that he <unk> her <unk> in every way 
in order to <unk> an <unk> ?" " that is a <unk> <unk> -- in <unk> , as matters <unk> 
, it is the most probable one . but in any case it does not <unk> to be a nice 
<unk> for a young lady ." " but the money , mr . holmes , the money !" " well 
, yes , of course the pay is good -- too good . that is what <unk> me <unk> . 
why should they give you <unk> pounds a year , when they could have their <unk> for <unk> pounds ? 
there must be some strong reason behind ." " i thought that if i told you the circumstances you would 
understand afterwards if i wanted your help . i should <unk> so much <unk> if i felt that you were 
at the back of me ." " oh , you may carry that <unk> away with you . i <unk> 
you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months . 
there is something <unk> <unk> about some of the features . if you should find yourself in doubt or in 
<unk> --" " <unk> ! what <unk> do you <unk> ?" holmes <unk> his head <unk> . " it would 
<unk> to be a <unk> if we could <unk> it ," said he . " but at any time , 
day or night , a <unk> would bring me down to your help ." " that is enough ." she 
rose <unk> from her chair with the anxiety all <unk> from her face . " i shall go down to 
<unk> quite easy in my mind now . i shall <unk> to mr . <unk> at once , <unk> my 
poor <unk> to - night , and start for <unk> to - morrow ." with a few <unk> <unk> to 
holmes she <unk> us both good - night and <unk> off upon her way . " at least ," said 
i as we heard her quick , <unk> steps <unk> the stairs , " she seems to be a young 
lady who is very well able to take care of herself ." " and she would need to be ," 
said holmes <unk> . " i am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are 
past ." it was not very long before my friend ' s <unk> was <unk> . a <unk> went by 
, during which i frequently found my <unk> <unk> in her direction and wondering what strange side - <unk> of 
<unk> <unk> this <unk> woman had <unk> into . the unusual <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , the light <unk> 
, all <unk> to something <unk> , though whether a <unk> or a <unk> , or whether the man were 
a <unk> or a <unk> , it was quite beyond my powers to <unk> . as to holmes , i 
observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end , with <unk> <unk> and an <unk> air , 
but he <unk> the matter away with a <unk> of his hand when i <unk> it . " data ! 
data ! data !" he cried impatiently . " i can ' t make <unk> without <unk> ." and yet 
he would always wind up by <unk> that no <unk> of his should ever have <unk> such a situation . 
the <unk> which we <unk> received came late one night just as i was <unk> of <unk> in and holmes 
was settling down to one of those all - night <unk> <unk> which he frequently <unk> in , when i 
would leave him <unk> over a <unk> and a <unk> - <unk> at night and find him in the same 
position when i came down to <unk> in the morning . he opened the <unk> <unk> , and then , 
glancing at the <unk> , threw it across to me . " just look up the <unk> in <unk> ," 
said he , and turned back to his <unk> <unk> . the summons was a <unk> and <unk> one . 
" please be at the black <unk> <unk> at <unk> at <unk> to - morrow ," it said . " 
do come ! i am at my <unk> ' s end . <unk> ." " will you come with me 
?" asked holmes , glancing up . " i should wish to ." " just look it up , then 
." " there is a train at half - past <unk> ," said i , glancing over my <unk> . 
" it is <unk> at <unk> at <unk> : <unk> ." " that will do very nicely . then perhaps 
i had better <unk> my <unk> of the <unk> , as we may need to be at our best in 
the morning ." by <unk> o ' clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old 
english capital . holmes had been buried in the morning papers all the way down , but after we had 
passed the <unk> <unk> he threw them down and began to <unk> the <unk> . it was an <unk> <unk> 
day , a light blue <unk> , <unk> with little <unk> white clouds <unk> across from <unk> to <unk> . 
the <unk> was <unk> very <unk> , and yet there was an <unk> <unk> in the air , which <unk> 
an <unk> to a man ' s energy . all over the <unk> , away to the <unk> <unk> around 
<unk> , the little red and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> - <unk> <unk> out from <unk> the light <unk> 
of the new <unk> . " are they not fresh and beautiful ?" i cried with all the <unk> of 
a man fresh from the <unk> of baker street . but holmes <unk> his head <unk> . " do you 
know , watson ," said he , " that it is one of the <unk> of a mind with a 
turn like mine that i must look at <unk> with <unk> to my own <unk> subject . you look at 
these scattered houses , and you are <unk> by their <unk> . i look at them , and the only 
thought which comes to me is a <unk> of their <unk> and of the <unk> with which crime may be 
committed there ." " good <unk> !" i cried . " who would <unk> crime with these dear old <unk> 
?" " they always <unk> me with a certain <unk> . it is my <unk> , watson , <unk> upon 
my <unk> , that the <unk> and <unk> <unk> in london do not present a more dreadful <unk> of <unk> 
than does the <unk> and beautiful <unk> ." " you <unk> me !" " but the reason is very <unk> 
. the <unk> of <unk> <unk> can do in the <unk> what the law <unk> <unk> . there is no 
lane so vile that the <unk> of a <unk> child , or the <unk> of a <unk> ' s blow 
, does not <unk> sympathy and <unk> among the <unk> , and then the whole <unk> of <unk> is ever 
so close that a word of <unk> can <unk> it <unk> , and there is but a step between the 
crime and the <unk> . but look at these <unk> houses , each in its own <unk> , <unk> for 
the most part with poor <unk> <unk> who know little of the law . think of the <unk> of <unk> 
<unk> , the <unk> <unk> which may go on , year in , year out , in such <unk> , 
and none the <unk> . had this lady who <unk> to us for help gone to <unk> in <unk> , 
i should never have had a fear for her . it is the five <unk> of country which <unk> the 
<unk> . still , it is clear that she is not <unk> <unk> ." " no . if she can 
come to <unk> to meet us she can get away ." " quite so . she has her freedom ." 
" what can be the matter , then ? can you <unk> no <unk> ?" " i have <unk> seven 
<unk> <unk> , each of which would <unk> the facts as far as we know them . but which of 
these is <unk> can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us 
. well , there is the <unk> of the <unk> , and we shall soon <unk> all that miss <unk> 
has to tell ." the black <unk> is an <unk> of <unk> in the high street , at no <unk> 
from the station , and there we found the young lady waiting for us . she had engaged a sitting 
- room , and our <unk> <unk> us upon the table . " i am so delighted that you have 
come ," she said earnestly . " it is so very kind of you both ; but indeed i do 
not know what i should do . your <unk> will be <unk> <unk> to me ." " pray tell us 
what has <unk> to you ." " i will do so , and i must be quick , for i 
have <unk> mr . <unk> to be back before three . i got his leave to come into <unk> this 
morning , though he little knew for what purpose ." " let us have <unk> in its <unk> order ." 
holmes <unk> his long <unk> legs out towards the fire and <unk> himself to listen . " in the first 
<unk> , i may say that i have <unk> , on the whole , with no <unk> ill - <unk> 
from mr . and mrs . <unk> . it is only <unk> to them to say that . but i 
<unk> understand them , and i am not easy in my mind about them ." " what can you not 
understand ?" " their reasons for their conduct . but you shall have it all just as it <unk> . 
when i came down , mr . <unk> <unk> me here and drove me in his <unk> - <unk> to 
the copper beeches . it is , as he said , beautifully <unk> , but it is not beautiful in 
itself , for it is a large <unk> <unk> of a house , <unk> , but all <unk> and <unk> 
with <unk> and bad weather . there are <unk> round it , <unk> on three sides , and on the 
<unk> a field which <unk> down to the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> past about a hundred <unk> from the 
front door . this ground in front <unk> to the house , but the <unk> all round are part of 
<unk> <unk> ' s <unk> . a <unk> of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given 
its name to the <unk> . " i was driven over by my <unk> , who was as amiable as 
ever , and was <unk> by him that evening to his wife and the child . there was no <unk> 
, mr . holmes , in the <unk> which seemed to us to be probable in your rooms at baker 
street . mrs . <unk> is not mad . i found her to be a <unk> , <unk> - faced 
woman , much <unk> than her husband , not more than thirty , i should think , while he can 
hardly be less than <unk> - five . from their <unk> i have <unk> that they have been married about 
seven years , that he was a <unk> , and that his only child by the first wife was the 
daughter who has gone to <unk> . mr . <unk> told me in private that the reason why she had 
left them was that she had an <unk> <unk> to her <unk> . as the daughter could not have been 
less than twenty , i can quite imagine that her position must have been <unk> with her <unk> ' s 
young wife . " mrs . <unk> seemed to me to be <unk> in mind as well as in <unk> 
. she <unk> me neither <unk> nor the <unk> . she was a <unk> . it was easy to see 
that she was <unk> <unk> both to her husband and to her little <unk> . her light <unk> eyes <unk> 
<unk> from one to the other , noting every little want and <unk> it if <unk> . he was kind 
to her also in his <unk> , <unk> fashion , and on the whole they seemed to be a <unk> 
<unk> . and yet she had some secret <unk> , this woman . she would often be lost in deep 
thought , with the <unk> look upon her face . more than once i have <unk> her in <unk> . 
i have thought <unk> that it was the <unk> of her child which <unk> upon her mind , for i 
have never <unk> so <unk> <unk> and so ill - <unk> a little creature . he is small for his 
<unk> , with a head which is quite <unk> large . his whole life appears to be <unk> in an 
<unk> between <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> . <unk> <unk> to any creature <unk> than himself 
seems to be his one <unk> of <unk> , and he <unk> quite remarkable <unk> in <unk> the <unk> of 
<unk> , little <unk> , and <unk> . but i would rather not <unk> about the creature , mr . 
holmes , and , indeed , he has little to do with my story ." " i am glad of 
all details ," remarked my friend , " whether they <unk> to you to be <unk> or not ." " 
i shall <unk> not to miss anything of importance . the one <unk> thing about the house , which struck 
me at once , was the appearance and conduct of the <unk> . there are only two , a man 
and his wife . <unk> , for that is his name , is a rough , <unk> man , with 
<unk> <unk> and <unk> , and a <unk> <unk> of <unk> . twice since i have been with them he 
has been quite <unk> , and yet mr . <unk> seemed to take no notice of it . his wife 
is a very tall and strong woman with a <unk> face , as <unk> as mrs . <unk> and much 
less amiable . they are a most <unk> <unk> , but <unk> i <unk> most of my time in the 
<unk> and my own room , which are next to each other in one corner of the <unk> . " 
for two days after my <unk> at the copper beeches my life was very quiet ; on the <unk> , 
mrs . <unk> came down just after <unk> and whispered something to her husband . "' oh , yes ,' 
said he , <unk> to me , ' we are very much obliged to you , miss <unk> , for 
<unk> in with our <unk> so far as to <unk> your <unk> . i <unk> you that it has not 
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> from your appearance . we shall now see how the <unk> - blue dress will 
<unk> you . you will find it laid out upon the <unk> in your room , and if you would 
be so good as to put it on we should both be <unk> obliged .' " the dress which i 
found waiting for me was of a peculiar <unk> of blue . it was of excellent <unk> , a sort 
of <unk> , but it bore <unk> signs of having been <unk> before . it could not have been a 
better <unk> if i had been <unk> for it . both mr . and mrs . <unk> <unk> a <unk> 
at the look of it , which seemed quite exaggerated in its <unk> . they were waiting for me in 
the drawing - room , which is a very large room , <unk> <unk> the <unk> front of the house 
, with three long windows <unk> down to the floor . a chair had been placed close to the <unk> 
window , with its back turned towards it . in this i was asked to sit , and then mr 
. <unk> , walking up and down on the other side of the room , began to tell me a 
<unk> of the <unk> stories that i have ever listened to . you <unk> imagine how <unk> he was , 
and i laughed until i was quite <unk> . mrs . <unk> , however , who has evidently no <unk> 
of <unk> , never so much as <unk> , but sat with her hands in her <unk> , and a 
<unk> , <unk> look upon her face . after an hour or so , mr . <unk> suddenly remarked that 
it was time to <unk> the <unk> of the day , and that i might change my dress and go 
to little <unk> in the <unk> . " two days later this same <unk> was gone through under exactly <unk> 
circumstances . again i changed my dress , again i sat in the window , and again i laughed very 
heartily at the funny stories of which my <unk> had an immense <unk> © <unk> , and which he told 
<unk> . then he handed me a <unk> - <unk> <unk> , and <unk> my chair a little <unk> , 
that my own shadow might not fall upon the <unk> , he <unk> me to read aloud to him . 
i read for about ten minutes , <unk> in the heart of a <unk> , and then suddenly , in 
the <unk> of a sentence , he <unk> me to <unk> and to change my dress . " you can 
easily imagine , mr . holmes , how <unk> i became as to what the <unk> of this extraordinary <unk> 
could <unk> be . they were always very <unk> , i observed , to turn my face away from the 
window , so that i became <unk> with the desire to see what was <unk> on behind my back . 
at first it seemed to be <unk> , but i soon <unk> a means . my hand - <unk> had 
been broken , so a <unk> thought seized me , and i <unk> a <unk> of the glass in my 
<unk> . on the next occasion , in the <unk> of my <unk> , i put my <unk> up to 
my eyes , and was able with a little <unk> to see all that there was behind me . i 
confess that i was <unk> . there was nothing . at least that was my first impression . at the 
second glance , however , i <unk> that there was a man standing in the <unk> road , a small 
<unk> man in a <unk> suit , who seemed to be looking in my direction . the road is an 
important <unk> , and there are <unk> people there . this man , however , was <unk> against the <unk> 
which <unk> our field and was looking earnestly up . i <unk> my <unk> and glanced at mrs . <unk> 
to find her eyes <unk> upon me with a most searching gaze . she said nothing , but i am 
<unk> that she had <unk> that i had a <unk> in my hand and had seen what was behind me 
. she rose at once . "' <unk> ,' said she , ' there is an <unk> fellow upon the 
road there who <unk> up at miss <unk> .' "' no friend of yours , miss <unk> ?' he asked 
. "' no , i know no one in these <unk> .' "' dear me ! how very <unk> ! 
kindly turn round and motion to him to go away .' "' surely it would be better to take no 
notice .' "' no , no , we should have him <unk> here always . kindly turn round and <unk> 
him away like that .' " i did as i was told , and at the same instant mrs . 
<unk> drew down the blind . that was a week ago , and from that time i have not sat 
again in the window , nor have i <unk> the blue dress , nor seen the man in the road 
." " pray continue ," said holmes . " your <unk> promises to be a most interesting one ." " 
you will find it rather <unk> , i fear , and there may prove to be little relation between the 
different incidents of which i speak . on the very first day that i was at the copper beeches , 
mr . <unk> took me to a small <unk> which stands near the <unk> door . as we <unk> it 
i heard the sharp <unk> of a chain , and the sound as of a large <unk> <unk> about . 
"' look in here !' said mr . <unk> , showing me a <unk> between two <unk> . ' is 
he not a <unk> ?' " i looked through and was <unk> of two <unk> eyes , and of a 
vague figure <unk> up in the <unk> . "' don ' t be <unk> ,' said my <unk> , laughing 
at the start which i had given . ' it ' s only <unk> , my <unk> . i call 
him mine , but really old <unk> , my groom , is the only man who can do anything with 
him . we <unk> him once a day , and not too much then , so that he is always 
as keen as <unk> . <unk> <unk> him <unk> every night , and god help the <unk> whom he <unk> 
his <unk> upon . for <unk> ' <unk> don ' t you ever on any <unk> <unk> your <unk> over 
the <unk> at night , for it ' s as much as your life is <unk> .' " the <unk> 
was no <unk> one , for two <unk> later i <unk> to look out of my bedroom window about two 
o ' clock in the morning . it was a beautiful <unk> night , and the <unk> in front of 
the house was <unk> over and almost as <unk> as day . i was standing , <unk> in the <unk> 
<unk> of the scene , when i was aware that something was <unk> under the shadow of the copper beeches 
. as it emerged into the <unk> i saw what it was . it was a <unk> <unk> , as 
large as a <unk> , <unk> tinted , with hanging <unk> , black <unk> , and <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
it walked slowly across the <unk> and vanished into the shadow upon the other side . that dreadful <unk> sent 
a <unk> to my heart which i do not think that any <unk> could have done . " and now 
i have a very strange <unk> to tell you . i had , as you know , <unk> off my 
<unk> in london , and i had placed it in a great <unk> at the <unk> of my <unk> . 
one evening , after the child was in <unk> , i began to <unk> myself by <unk> the furniture of 
my room and by <unk> my own little things . there was an old chest of drawers in the room 
, the two upper <unk> empty and open , the lower one <unk> . i had <unk> the first two 
with my <unk> , and as i had still much to <unk> away i was naturally <unk> at not having 
the use of the <unk> <unk> . it struck me that it might have been <unk> by a <unk> <unk> 
, so i took out my <unk> of <unk> and tried to open it . the very first key fitted 
to <unk> , and i drew the <unk> open . there was only one thing in it , but i 
am sure that you would never guess what it was . it was my <unk> of <unk> . " i 
took it up and examined it . it was of the same peculiar <unk> , and the same <unk> . 
but then the <unk> of the thing <unk> itself upon me . how could my <unk> have been <unk> in 
the <unk> ? with <unk> hands i <unk> my <unk> , turned out the <unk> , and drew from the 
<unk> my own <unk> . i laid the two <unk> together , and i <unk> you that they were <unk> 
. was it not extraordinary ? <unk> as i would , i could make nothing at all of what it 
<unk> . i returned the strange <unk> to the <unk> , and i said nothing of the matter to the 
<unk> as i felt that i had put myself in the <unk> by opening a <unk> which they had <unk> 
. " i am naturally <unk> , as you may have remarked , mr . holmes , and i soon 
had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head . there was one <unk> , however , 
which appeared not to be <unk> at all . a door which faced that which led into the quarters of 
the <unk> opened into this <unk> , but it was <unk> <unk> . one day , however , as i 
<unk> the <unk> , i <unk> mr . <unk> coming out through this door , his <unk> in his hand 
, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round , <unk> man 
to whom i was accustomed . his <unk> were red , his <unk> was all <unk> with <unk> , and 
the <unk> stood out at his <unk> with <unk> . he <unk> the door and hurried past me without a 
word or a look . " this <unk> my curiosity , so when i went out for a walk in 
the <unk> with my <unk> , i <unk> round to the side from which i could see the windows of 
this part of the house . there were four of them in a row , three of which were <unk> 
<unk> , while the <unk> was <unk> up . they were evidently all <unk> . as i <unk> up and 
down , glancing at them occasionally , mr . <unk> came out to me , looking as <unk> and <unk> 
as ever . "' ah !' said he , ' you must not think me <unk> if i passed you 
without a word , my dear young lady . i was <unk> with business matters .' " i <unk> him 
that i was not <unk> . ' by the way ,' said i , ' you <unk> to have quite 
a <unk> of spare rooms up there , and one of them has the <unk> up .' " he looked 
<unk> and , as it seemed to me , a little startled at my <unk> . "' <unk> is one 
of my <unk> ,' said he . ' i have made my dark room up there . but , dear 
me ! what an <unk> young lady we have come upon . who would have <unk> it ? who would 
have ever <unk> it ?' he spoke in a <unk> <unk> , but there was no <unk> in his eyes 
as he looked at me . i read suspicion there and annoyance , but no <unk> . " well , 
mr . holmes , from the moment that i <unk> that there was something about that <unk> of rooms which 
i was not to know , i was all on fire to go over them . it was not <unk> 
curiosity , though i have my <unk> of that . it was more a <unk> of <unk> -- a <unk> 
that some good might come from my <unk> to this <unk> . they <unk> of woman ' s instinct ; 
perhaps it was woman ' s instinct which gave me that <unk> . at any <unk> , it was there 
, and i was <unk> on the <unk> for any chance to pass the <unk> door . " it was 
only yesterday that the chance came . i may tell you that , besides mr . <unk> , both <unk> 
and his wife find something to do in these <unk> rooms , and i once saw him <unk> a large 
black <unk> bag with him through the door . <unk> he has been <unk> hard , and yesterday evening he 
was very <unk> ; and when i came <unk> there was the key in the door . i have no 
doubt at all that he had left it there . mr . and mrs . <unk> were both <unk> , 
and the child was with them , so that i had an admirable <unk> . i turned the key <unk> 
in the lock , opened the door , and <unk> through . " there was a little passage in front 
of me , <unk> and <unk> , which turned at a right <unk> at the <unk> end . round this 
corner were three <unk> in a line , the first and <unk> of which were open . they each led 
into an empty room , <unk> and <unk> , with two windows in the one and one in the other 
, so thick with <unk> that the evening light <unk> dimly through them . the centre door was <unk> , 
and across the outside of it had been <unk> one of the broad <unk> of an <unk> <unk> , <unk> 
at one end to a ring in the wall , and <unk> at the other with <unk> <unk> . the 
door itself was <unk> as well , and the key was not there . this <unk> door <unk> <unk> with 
the <unk> window outside , and yet i could see by the <unk> from <unk> it that the room was 
not in <unk> . evidently there was a <unk> which let in light from above . as i stood in 
the passage <unk> at the <unk> door and wondering what secret it might veil , i suddenly heard the sound 
of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass <unk> and forward against the little <unk> of <unk> light 
which <unk> out from under the door . a mad , <unk> <unk> rose up in me at the <unk> 
, mr . holmes . my <unk> nerves failed me suddenly , and i turned and ran -- ran as 
though some dreadful hand were behind me <unk> at the <unk> of my dress . i rushed down the passage 
, through the door , and straight into the arms of mr . <unk> , who was waiting outside . 
"' so ,' said he , <unk> , ' it was you , then . i thought that it must 
be when i saw the door open .' "' oh , i am so <unk> !' i <unk> . "' 
my dear young lady ! my dear young lady <unk> you <unk> think how <unk> and <unk> his manner was 
--' and what has <unk> you , my dear young lady ?' " but his voice was just a little 
too <unk> . he <unk> it . i was <unk> on my <unk> against him . "' i was <unk> 
enough to go into the empty <unk> ,' i answered . ' but it is so <unk> and <unk> in 
this <unk> light that i was <unk> and ran out again . oh , it is so <unk> still in 
there !' "' only that ?' said he , looking at me <unk> . "' why , what did you 
think ?' i asked . "' why do you think that i lock this door ?' "' i am sure 
that i do not know .' "' it is to keep people out who have no business there . do 
you see ?' he was still <unk> in the most amiable manner . "' i am sure if i had 
known --' "' well , then , you know now . and if you ever put your <unk> over that 
<unk> again <unk> here in an instant the smile hardened into a <unk> of <unk> , and he <unk> down 
at me with the face of a <unk> --' i ' ll throw you to the <unk> .' " i 
was so <unk> that i do not know what i did . i suppose that i must have rushed past 
him into my room . i remember nothing until i found myself lying on my <unk> <unk> all over . 
then i thought of you , mr . holmes . i could not <unk> there <unk> without some <unk> . 
i was <unk> of the house , of the man , of the woman , of the <unk> , even 
of the child . they were all <unk> to me . if i could only bring you down all would 
be well . of course i might have <unk> from the house , but my curiosity was almost as strong 
as my <unk> . my mind was soon made up . i would send you a wire . i put 
on my hat and cloak , went down to the <unk> , which is about half a <unk> from the 
house , and then returned , <unk> very much <unk> . a <unk> doubt came into my mind as i 
<unk> the door <unk> the <unk> might be <unk> , but i remembered that <unk> had <unk> himself into a 
state of <unk> that evening , and i knew that he was the only one in the <unk> who had 
any influence with the <unk> creature , or who would <unk> to <unk> him <unk> . i <unk> in in 
<unk> and lay <unk> half the night in my <unk> at the thought of <unk> you . i had no 
<unk> in getting leave to come into <unk> this morning , but i must be back before three o ' 
clock , for mr . and mrs . <unk> are <unk> on a visit , and will be away all 
the evening , so that i must look after the child . now i have told you all my adventures 
, mr . holmes , and i should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means 
, and , above all , what i should do ." holmes and i had listened <unk> to this extraordinary 
story . my friend rose now and paced up and down the room , his hands in his pockets , 
and an expression of the most <unk> <unk> upon his face . " is <unk> still <unk> ?" he asked 
. " yes . i heard his wife tell mrs . <unk> that she could do nothing with him ." 
" that is well . and the <unk> go out to - night ?" " yes ." " is there 
a <unk> with a good strong lock ?" " yes , the <unk> - <unk> ." " you <unk> to 
me to have <unk> all through this matter like a very brave and <unk> girl , miss <unk> . do 
you think that you could <unk> one more <unk> ? i should not <unk> it of you if i did 
not think you a quite <unk> woman ." " i will <unk> . what is it ?" " we shall 
be at the copper beeches by seven o ' clock , my friend and i . the <unk> will be 
gone by that time , and <unk> will , we hope , be <unk> . there only remains mrs . 
<unk> , who might give the alarm . if you could send her into the <unk> on some <unk> , 
and then turn the key upon her , you would <unk> matters immensely ." " i will do it ." 
" excellent ! we shall then look thoroughly into the <unk> . of course there is only one <unk> <unk> 
. you have been brought there to <unk> someone , and the <unk> person is <unk> in this chamber . 
that is <unk> . as to who this <unk> is , i have no doubt that it is the daughter 
, miss <unk> <unk> , if i remember right , who was said to have gone to <unk> . you 
were <unk> , <unk> , as <unk> her in height , figure , and the <unk> of your <unk> . 
<unk> had been <unk> off , very <unk> in some <unk> through which she has passed , and so , 
of course , yours had to be <unk> also . by a <unk> chance you came upon her <unk> . 
the man in the road was <unk> some friend of <unk> -- <unk> her <unk> <unk> and no doubt , 
as you wore the girl ' s dress and were so like her , he was <unk> from your <unk> 
, <unk> he saw you , and afterwards from your gesture , that miss <unk> was perfectly <unk> , and 
that she no <unk> <unk> his <unk> . the <unk> is let <unk> at night to <unk> him from endeavouring 
to communicate with her . so much is <unk> clear . the most serious point in the case is the 
<unk> of the child ." " what on <unk> has that to do with it ?" i <unk> . " 
my dear watson , you as a medical man are <unk> <unk> light as to the <unk> of a child 
by the study of the <unk> . don ' t you see that the <unk> is equally <unk> . i 
have frequently <unk> my first <unk> <unk> into the character of <unk> by <unk> their <unk> . this child ' 
s <unk> is <unk> <unk> , merely for <unk> ' s <unk> , and whether he <unk> this from his 
<unk> <unk> , as i should <unk> , or from his <unk> , it <unk> evil for the poor girl 
who is in their power ." " i am sure that you are right , mr . holmes ," cried 
our client . " a <unk> things come back to me which make me certain that you have <unk> it 
. oh , let us lose not an instant in <unk> help to this poor creature ." " we must 
be <unk> , for we are <unk> with a very <unk> man . we can do nothing until seven o 
' clock . at that hour we shall be with you , and it will not be long before we 
<unk> the mystery ." we were as good as our word , for it was just seven when we reached 
the copper beeches , having put up our <unk> at a <unk> <unk> - house . the group of <unk> 
, with their dark <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> in the light of the <unk> <unk> , were sufficient to 
mark the house even had miss <unk> not been standing <unk> on the door - step . " have you 
<unk> it ?" asked holmes . a loud <unk> <unk> came from <unk> <unk> . " that is mrs . 
<unk> in the <unk> ," said she . " her husband <unk> <unk> on the <unk> <unk> . here are 
his <unk> , which are the <unk> of mr . <unk> ' s ." " you have done well indeed 
!" cried holmes with <unk> . " now lead the way , and we shall soon see the end of 
this black business ." we passed up the <unk> , <unk> the door , followed on down a passage , 
and found ourselves in front of the <unk> which miss <unk> had <unk> . holmes <unk> the <unk> and <unk> 
the <unk> <unk> . then he tried the <unk> <unk> in the lock , but without success . no sound 
came from within , and at the silence holmes ' face <unk> over . " i trust that we are 
not too late ," said he . " i think , miss <unk> , that we had better go in 
without you . now , watson , put your shoulder to it , and we shall see whether we <unk> 
make our way in ." it was an old <unk> door and gave at once before our <unk> <unk> . 
together we rushed into the room . it was empty . there was no furniture save a little <unk> <unk> 
, a small table , and a <unk> of <unk> . the <unk> above was open , and the <unk> 
gone . " there has been some <unk> here ," said holmes ; " this <unk> has guessed miss <unk> 
' s <unk> and has carried his <unk> off ." " but how ?" " through the <unk> . we 
shall soon see how he <unk> it ." he <unk> himself up <unk> the <unk> . " ah , yes 
," he cried , " here ' s the end of a long light <unk> against the <unk> . that 
is how he did it ." " but it is <unk> ," said miss <unk> ; " the <unk> was 
not there when the <unk> went away ." " he has come back and done it . i tell you 
that he is a <unk> and <unk> man . i should not be very much <unk> if this were he 
whose step i hear now upon the <unk> . i think , watson , that it would be as well 
for you to have your <unk> <unk> ." the <unk> were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared 
at the door of the room , a very <unk> and <unk> man , with a heavy <unk> in his 
hand . miss <unk> <unk> and <unk> against the wall at the <unk> of him , but sherlock holmes sprang 
forward and <unk> him . " you <unk> !" said he , " where ' s your daughter ?" the 
<unk> man <unk> his eyes round , and then up at the open <unk> . " it is for me 
to <unk> you that ," he <unk> , " you <unk> ! <unk> and <unk> ! i have caught you 
, have i ? you are in my power . i ' ll <unk> you !" he turned and <unk> 
down the stairs as hard as he could go . " he ' s gone for the <unk> !" cried 
miss <unk> . " i have my <unk> ," said i . " better close the front door ," cried 
holmes , and we all rushed down the stairs together . we had hardly reached the hall when we heard 
the <unk> of a <unk> , and then a <unk> of <unk> , with a <unk> <unk> sound which it 
was dreadful to listen to . an elderly man with a red face and <unk> limbs came <unk> out at 
a side door . " my god !" he cried . " someone has <unk> the <unk> . it ' 
s not been <unk> for two days . quick , quick , or it ' ll be too late !" 
holmes and i rushed out and round the <unk> of the house , with <unk> <unk> behind us . there 
was the <unk> <unk> <unk> , its black <unk> buried in <unk> ' s <unk> , while he <unk> and 
<unk> upon the ground . running up , i <unk> its <unk> out , and it fell over with its 
keen white <unk> still <unk> in the great <unk> of his neck . with much <unk> we separated them and 
carried him , living but <unk> <unk> , into the house . we laid him upon the drawing - room 
sofa , and having <unk> the <unk> <unk> to bear the news to his wife , i did what i 
could to <unk> his <unk> . we were all <unk> round him when the door opened , and a tall 
, <unk> woman entered the room . " mrs . <unk> !" cried miss <unk> . " yes , miss 
. mr . <unk> let me out when he came back before he went up to you . ah , 
miss , it is a pity you <unk> ' t let me know what you were <unk> , for i 
would have told you that your <unk> were <unk> ." " ha !" said holmes , looking <unk> at her 
. " it is clear that mrs . <unk> knows more about this matter than anyone else ." " yes 
, sir , i do , and i am <unk> enough to tell what i know ." " then , 
pray , sit down , and let us hear it for there are several <unk> on which i must confess 
that i am still in the dark ." " i will soon make it clear to you ," said she 
; " and i ' <unk> have done so before now if i could ha ' got out from the 
<unk> . if there ' s police - <unk> business over this , you ' ll remember that i was 
the one that stood your friend , and that i was miss <unk> ' s friend too . " she 
was never <unk> at home , miss <unk> <unk> ' t , from the time that her <unk> married again 
. she was <unk> like and had no say in anything , but it never really became bad for her 
until after she <unk> mr . <unk> at a friend ' s house . as well as i could <unk> 
, miss <unk> had <unk> of her own by will , but she was so quiet and patient , she 
was , that she never said a word about them but just left <unk> in mr . <unk> ' s 
hands . he knew he was safe with her ; but when there was a chance of a husband coming 
forward , who would <unk> for all that the law would give him , then her <unk> thought it time 
to put a <unk> on it . he wanted her to sign a paper , so that whether she married 
or not , he could use her money . when she <unk> ' t do it , he <unk> on 
<unk> her until she got <unk> - <unk> , and for six <unk> was at death ' s door . 
then she got better at last , all <unk> to a shadow , and with her beautiful <unk> <unk> off 
; but that <unk> ' t make no change in her young man , and he <unk> to her as 
true as man could be ." " ah ," said holmes , " i think that what you have been 
good enough to tell us <unk> the matter <unk> clear , and that i can deduce all that remains . 
mr . <unk> then , i <unk> , took to this system of <unk> ?" " yes , sir ." 
" and brought miss <unk> down from london in order to get <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of mr . 
<unk> ." " that was it , sir ." " but mr . <unk> being a <unk> man , as 
a good <unk> should be , <unk> the house , and having <unk> you <unk> by certain <unk> , <unk> 
or <unk> , in <unk> you that your interests were the same as his ." " mr . <unk> was 
a very kind - spoken , <unk> - handed gentleman ," said mrs . <unk> <unk> . " and in 
this way he <unk> that your good man should have no want of <unk> , and that a <unk> should 
be <unk> at the moment when your master had gone out ." " you have it , sir , just 
as it <unk> ." " i am sure we <unk> you an <unk> , mrs . <unk> ," said holmes 
, " for you have certainly <unk> up <unk> which <unk> us . and here comes the country <unk> and 
mrs . <unk> , so i think , watson , that we had best <unk> miss <unk> back to <unk> 
, as it seems to me that our <unk> <unk> now is rather a questionable one ." and <unk> was 
<unk> the mystery of the <unk> house with the copper beeches in front of the door . mr . <unk> 
<unk> , but was always a broken man , <unk> <unk> <unk> through the care of his <unk> wife . 
they still <unk> with their old <unk> , who probably know so much of <unk> ' s past life that 
he finds it difficult to part from them . mr . <unk> and miss <unk> were married , by <unk> 
license , in <unk> the day after their flight , and he is now the <unk> of a <unk> <unk> 
in the <unk> of <unk> . as to miss <unk> <unk> , my friend holmes , rather to my <unk> 
, <unk> no <unk> interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his 
problems , and she is now the head of a private <unk> at <unk> , where i believe that she 
has <unk> with <unk> success . end of the project gutenberg ebook of the adventures of sherlock holmes , by

of the copper beeches adventure i . a scandal in bohemia i . to sherlock holmes she is always the 
woman . i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name . in his eyes she eclipses and 
predominates the whole of her sex . it was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for irene 
adler . all emotions , and that one particularly , were abhorrent to his cold , precise but admirably balanced 
mind . he was , i take it , the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has 
seen , but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position . he never spoke of 
the softer passions , save with a gibe and a sneer . they were admirable things for the observer -- 
excellent for drawing the veil from men ' s motives and actions . but for the trained reasoner to admit 
such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a 
doubt upon all his mental results . grit in a sensitive instrument , or a crack in one of his 
own high - power lenses , would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as 
his . and yet there was but one woman to him , and that woman was the late irene adler 
, of dubious and questionable memory . i had seen little of holmes lately . my marriage had drifted us 
away from each other . my own complete happiness , and the home - centred interests which rise up around 
the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment , were sufficient to absorb all my attention , 
while holmes , who loathed every form of society with his whole bohemian soul , remained in our lodgings in 
baker street , buried among his old books , and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition , 
the drowsiness of the drug , and the fierce energy of his own keen nature . he was still , 
as ever , deeply attracted by the study of crime , and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of 
observation in following out those clues , and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the 
official police . from time to time i heard some vague account of his doings : of his summons to 
odessa in the case of the trepoff murder , of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the atkinson 
brothers at trincomalee , and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning 
family of holland . beyond these signs of his activity , however , which i merely shared with all the 
readers of the daily press , i knew little of my former friend and companion . one night -- it 
was on the twentieth of march , 1888 -- i was returning from a journey to a patient ( for 
i had now returned to civil practice ), when my way led me through baker street . as i passed 
the well - remembered door , which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing , and with 
the dark incidents of the study in scarlet , i was seized with a keen desire to see holmes again 
, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers . his rooms were brilliantly lit , and , 
even as i looked up , i saw his tall , spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against 
the blind . he was pacing the room swiftly , eagerly , with his head sunk upon his chest and 
his hands clasped behind him . to me , who knew his every mood and habit , his attitude and 
manner told their own story . he was at work again . he had risen out of his drug - 
created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem . i rang the bell and was shown 
up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own . his manner was not effusive . it 
seldom was ; but he was glad , i think , to see me . with hardly a word spoken 
, but with a kindly eye , he waved me to an armchair , threw across his case of cigars 
, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner . then he stood before the fire and 
looked me over in his singular introspective fashion . " wedlock suits you ," he remarked . " i think 
, watson , that you have put on seven and a half pounds since i saw you ." " seven 
!" i answered . " indeed , i should have thought a little more . just a trifle more , 
i fancy , watson . and in practice again , i observe . you did not tell me that you 
intended to go into harness ." " then , how do you know ?" " i see it , i 
deduce it . how do i know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately , and that you 
have a most clumsy and careless servant girl ?" " my dear holmes ," said i , " this is 
too much . you would certainly have been burned , had you lived a few centuries ago . it is 
true that i had a country walk on thursday and came home in a dreadful mess , but as i 
have changed my clothes i can ' t imagine how you deduce it . as to mary jane , she 
is incorrigible , and my wife has given her notice , but there , again , i fail to see 
how you work it out ." he chuckled to himself and rubbed his long , nervous hands together . " 
it is simplicity itself ," said he ; " my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left 
shoe , just where the firelight strikes it , the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts . obviously 
they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to 
remove crusted mud from it . hence , you see , my double deduction that you had been out in 
vile weather , and that you had a particularly malignant boot - slitting specimen of the london slavey . as 
to your practice , if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform , with a black mark of 
nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger , and a bulge on the right side of his top - hat 
to show where he has secreted his stethoscope , i must be dull , indeed , if i do not 
pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession ." i could not help laughing at the ease 
with which he explained his process of deduction . " when i hear you give your reasons ," i remarked 
, " the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that i could easily do it myself 
, though at each successive instance of your reasoning i am baffled until you explain your process . and yet 
i believe that my eyes are as good as yours ." " quite so ," he answered , lighting a 
cigarette , and throwing himself down into an armchair . " you see , but you do not observe . 
the distinction is clear . for example , you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall 
to this room ." " frequently ." " how often ?" " well , some hundreds of times ." " 
then how many are there ?" " how many ? i don ' t know ." " quite so ! 
you have not observed . and yet you have seen . that is just my point . now , i 
know that there are seventeen steps , because i have both seen and observed . by - the - way 
, since you are interested in these little problems , and since you are good enough to chronicle one or 
two of my trifling experiences , you may be interested in this ." he threw over a sheet of thick 
, pink - tinted note - paper which had been lying open upon the table . " it came by 
the last post ," said he . " read it aloud ." the note was undated , and without either 
signature or address . " there will call upon you to - night , at a quarter to eight o 
' clock ," it said , " a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very 
deepest moment . your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one 
who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated . this account 
of you we have from all quarters received . be in your chamber then at that hour , and do 
not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask ." " this is indeed a mystery ," i remarked 
. " what do you imagine that it means ?" " i have no data yet . it is a 
capital mistake to theorize before one has data . insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories , instead 
of theories to suit facts . but the note itself . what do you deduce from it ?" i carefully 
examined the writing , and the paper upon which it was written . " the man who wrote it was 
presumably well to do ," i remarked , endeavouring to imitate my companion ' s processes . " such paper 
could not be bought under half a crown a packet . it is peculiarly strong and stiff ." " peculiar 
-- that is the very word ," said holmes . " it is not an english paper at all . 
hold it up to the light ." i did so , and saw a large " e " with a 
small " g ," a " p ," and a large " g " with a small " t " 
woven into the texture of the paper . " what do you make of that ?" asked holmes . " 
the name of the maker , no doubt ; or his monogram , rather ." " not at all . 
the ' g ' with the small ' t ' stands for ' gesellschaft ,' which is the german for 
' company .' it is a customary contraction like our ' co .' ' p ,' of course , stands 
for ' papier .' now for the ' eg .' let us glance at our continental gazetteer ." he took 
down a heavy brown volume from his shelves . " eglow , eglonitz -- here we are , egria . 
it is in a german - speaking country -- in bohemia , not far from carlsbad . ' remarkable as 
being the scene of the death of wallenstein , and for its numerous glass - factories and paper - mills 
.' ha , ha , my boy , what do you make of that ?" his eyes sparkled , and 
he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette . " the paper was made in bohemia ," 
i said . " precisely . and the man who wrote the note is a german . do you note 
the peculiar construction of the sentence --' this account of you we have from all quarters received .' a frenchman 
or russian could not have written that . it is the german who is so uncourteous to his verbs . 
it only remains , therefore , to discover what is wanted by this german who writes upon bohemian paper and 
prefers wearing a mask to showing his face . and here he comes , if i am not mistaken , 
to resolve all our doubts ." as he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses ' hoofs and grating 
wheels against the curb , followed by a sharp pull at the bell . holmes whistled . " a pair 
, by the sound ," said he . " yes ," he continued , glancing out of the window . 
" a nice little brougham and a pair of beauties . a hundred and fifty guineas apiece . there ' 
s money in this case , watson , if there is nothing else ." " i think that i had 
better go , holmes ." " not a bit , doctor . stay where you are . i am lost 
without my boswell . and this promises to be interesting . it would be a pity to miss it ." 
" but your client --" " never mind him . i may want your help , and so may he 
. here he comes . sit down in that armchair , doctor , and give us your best attention ." 
a slow and heavy step , which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage , paused immediately 
outside the door . then there was a loud and authoritative tap . " come in !" said holmes . 
a man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height , with the chest 
and limbs of a hercules . his dress was rich with a richness which would , in england , be 
looked upon as akin to bad taste . heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of 
his double - breasted coat , while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with 
flame - coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl . 
boots which extended halfway up his calves , and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur , 
completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance . he carried a broad - brimmed 
hat in his hand , while he wore across the upper part of his face , extending down past the 
cheekbones , a black vizard mask , which he had apparently adjusted that very moment , for his hand was 
still raised to it as he entered . from the lower part of the face he appeared to be a 
man of strong character , with a thick , hanging lip , and a long , straight chin suggestive of 
resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy . " you had my note ?" he asked with a deep harsh 
voice and a strongly marked german accent . " i told you that i would call ." he looked from 
one to the other of us , as if uncertain which to address . " pray take a seat ," 
said holmes . " this is my friend and colleague , dr . watson , who is occasionally good enough 
to help me in my cases . whom have i the honour to address ?" " you may address me 
as the count von kramm , a bohemian nobleman . i understand that this gentleman , your friend , is 
a man of honour and discretion , whom i may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance . 
if not , i should much prefer to communicate with you alone ." i rose to go , but holmes 
caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair . " it is both , or none 
," said he . " you may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me ." the 
count shrugged his broad shoulders . " then i must begin ," said he , " by binding you both 
to absolute secrecy for two years ; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance 
. at present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an 
influence upon european history ." " i promise ," said holmes . " and i ." " you will excuse 
this mask ," continued our strange visitor . " the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be 
unknown to you , and i may confess at once that the title by which i have just called myself 
is not exactly my own ." " i was aware of it ," said holmes dryly . " the circumstances 
are of great delicacy , and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an 
immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of europe . to speak plainly , the matter implicates 
the great house of ormstein , hereditary kings of bohemia ." " i was also aware of that ," murmured 
holmes , settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes . our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise 
at the languid , lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most 
incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in europe . holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic 
client . " if your majesty would condescend to state your case ," he remarked , " i should be 
better able to advise you ." the man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in 
uncontrollable agitation . then , with a gesture of desperation , he tore the mask from his face and hurled 
it upon the ground . " you are right ," he cried ; " i am the king . why 
should i attempt to conceal it ?" " why , indeed ?" murmured holmes . " your majesty had not 
spoken before i was aware that i was addressing wilhelm gottsreich sigismond von ormstein , grand duke of cassel - 
felstein , and hereditary king of bohemia ." " but you can understand ," said our strange visitor , sitting 
down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead , " you can understand that i am 
not accustomed to doing such business in my own person . yet the matter was so delicate that i could 
not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power . i have come incognito from prague for 
the purpose of consulting you ." " then , pray consult ," said holmes , shutting his eyes once more 
. " the facts are briefly these : some five years ago , during a lengthy visit to warsaw , 
i made the acquaintance of the well - known adventuress , irene adler . the name is no doubt familiar 
to you ." " kindly look her up in my index , doctor ," murmured holmes without opening his eyes 
. for many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things , so that 
it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information . 
in this case i found her biography sandwiched in between that of a hebrew rabbi and that of a staff 
- commander who had written a monograph upon the deep - sea fishes . " let me see !" said 
holmes . " hum ! born in new jersey in the year 1858 . contralto -- hum ! la scala 
, hum ! prima donna imperial opera of warsaw -- yes ! retired from operatic stage -- ha ! living 
in london -- quite so ! your majesty , as i understand , became entangled with this young person , 
wrote her some compromising letters , and is now desirous of getting those letters back ." " precisely so . 
but how --" " was there a secret marriage ?" " none ." " no legal papers or certificates ?" 
" none ." " then i fail to follow your majesty . if this young person should produce her letters 
for blackmailing or other purposes , how is she to prove their authenticity ?" " there is the writing ." 
" pooh , pooh ! forgery ." " my private note - paper ." " stolen ." " my own 
seal ." " imitated ." " my photograph ." " bought ." " we were both in the photograph ." 
" oh , dear ! that is very bad ! your majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion ." " i 
was mad -- insane ." " you have compromised yourself seriously ." " i was only crown prince then . 
i was young . i am but thirty now ." " it must be recovered ." " we have tried 
and failed ." " your majesty must pay . it must be bought ." " she will not sell ." 
" stolen , then ." " five attempts have been made . twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house 
. once we diverted her luggage when she travelled . twice she has been waylaid . there has been no 
result ." " no sign of it ?" " absolutely none ." holmes laughed . " it is quite a 
pretty little problem ," said he . " but a very serious one to me ," returned the king reproachfully 
. " very , indeed . and what does she propose to do with the photograph ?" " to ruin 
me ." " but how ?" " i am about to be married ." " so i have heard ." 
" to clotilde lothman von saxe - meningen , second daughter of the king of scandinavia . you may know 
the strict principles of her family . she is herself the very soul of delicacy . a shadow of a 
doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end ." " and irene adler ?" " threatens 
to send them the photograph . and she will do it . i know that she will do it . 
you do not know her , but she has a soul of steel . she has the face of the 
most beautiful of women , and the mind of the most resolute of men . rather than i should marry 
another woman , there are no lengths to which she would not go -- none ." " you are sure 
that she has not sent it yet ?" " i am sure ." " and why ?" " because she 
has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed . that will be 
next monday ." " oh , then we have three days yet ," said holmes with a yawn . " 
that is very fortunate , as i have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present 
. your majesty will , of course , stay in london for the present ?" " certainly . you will 
find me at the langham under the name of the count von kramm ." " then i shall drop you 
a line to let you know how we progress ." " pray do so . i shall be all anxiety 
." " then , as to money ?" " you have carte blanche ." " absolutely ?" " i tell 
you that i would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph ." " and for 
present expenses ?" the king took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the 
table . " there are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes ," he said . holmes 
scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note - book and handed it to him . " and mademoiselle 
' s address ?" he asked . " is briony lodge , serpentine avenue , st . john ' s 
wood ." holmes took a note of it . " one other question ," said he . " was the 
photograph a cabinet ?" " it was ." " then , good - night , your majesty , and i 
trust that we shall soon have some good news for you . and good - night , watson ," he 
added , as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street . " if you will be good 
enough to call to - morrow afternoon at three o ' clock i should like to chat this little matter 
over with you ." ii . at three o ' clock precisely i was at baker street , but holmes 
had not yet returned . the landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o ' 
clock in the morning . i sat down beside the fire , however , with the intention of awaiting him 
, however long he might be . i was already deeply interested in his inquiry , for , though it 
was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which i have 
already recorded , still , the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a 
character of its own . indeed , apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand 
, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation , and his keen , incisive reasoning , which 
made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work , and to follow the quick , subtle 
methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries . so accustomed was i to his invariable success that the 
very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head . it was close upon four before the 
door opened , and a drunken - looking groom , ill - kempt and side - whiskered , with an 
inflamed face and disreputable clothes , walked into the room . accustomed as i was to my friend ' s 
amazing powers in the use of disguises , i had to look three times before i was certain that it 
was indeed he . with a nod he vanished into the bedroom , whence he emerged in five minutes tweed 
- suited and respectable , as of old . putting his hands into his pockets , he stretched out his 
legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes . " well , really !" he cried 
, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back , limp and helpless , 
in the chair . " what is it ?" " it ' s quite too funny . i am sure 
you could never guess how i employed my morning , or what i ended by doing ." " i can 
' t imagine . i suppose that you have been watching the habits , and perhaps the house , of 
miss irene adler ." " quite so ; but the sequel was rather unusual . i will tell you , 
however . i left the house a little after eight o ' clock this morning in the character of a 
groom out of work . there is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men . be one of them 
, and you will know all that there is to know . i soon found briony lodge . it is 
a bijou villa , with a garden at the back , but built out in front right up to the 
road , two stories . chubb lock to the door . large sitting - room on the right side , 
well furnished , with long windows almost to the floor , and those preposterous english window fasteners which a child 
could open . behind there was nothing remarkable , save that the passage window could be reached from the top 
of the coach - house . i walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view , 
but without noting anything else of interest . " i then lounged down the street and found , as i 
expected , that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden . 
i lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses , and received in exchange twopence , a glass 
of half and half , two fills of shag tobacco , and as much information as i could desire about 
miss adler , to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom i was not 
in the least interested , but whose biographies i was compelled to listen to ." " and what of irene 
adler ?" i asked . " oh , she has turned all the men ' s heads down in that 
part . she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet . so say the serpentine - mews 
, to a man . she lives quietly , sings at concerts , drives out at five every day , 
and returns at seven sharp for dinner . seldom goes out at other times , except when she sings . 
has only one male visitor , but a good deal of him . he is dark , handsome , and 
dashing , never calls less than once a day , and often twice . he is a mr . godfrey 
norton , of the inner temple . see the advantages of a cabman as a confidant . they had driven 
him home a dozen times from serpentine - mews , and knew all about him . when i had listened 
to all they had to tell , i began to walk up and down near briony lodge once more , 
and to think over my plan of campaign . " this godfrey norton was evidently an important factor in the 
matter . he was a lawyer . that sounded ominous . what was the relation between them , and what 
the object of his repeated visits ? was she his client , his friend , or his mistress ? if 
the former , she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping . if the latter , it was less 
likely . on the issue of this question depended whether i should continue my work at briony lodge , or 
turn my attention to the gentleman ' s chambers in the temple . it was a delicate point , and 
it widened the field of my inquiry . i fear that i bore you with these details , but i 
have to let you see my little difficulties , if you are to understand the situation ." " i am 
following you closely ," i answered . " i was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom 
cab drove up to briony lodge , and a gentleman sprang out . he was a remarkably handsome man , 
dark , aquiline , and moustached -- evidently the man of whom i had heard . he appeared to be 
in a great hurry , shouted to the cabman to wait , and brushed past the maid who opened the 
door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home . " he was in the house about 
half an hour , and i could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting - room , 
pacing up and down , talking excitedly , and waving his arms . of her i could see nothing . 
presently he emerged , looking even more flurried than before . as he stepped up to the cab , he 
pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly , ' drive like the devil ,' he 
shouted , ' first to gross & hankey ' s in regent street , and then to the church of 
st . monica in the edgeware road . half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes !' " 
away they went , and i was just wondering whether i should not do well to follow them when up 
the lane came a neat little landau , the coachman with his coat only half - buttoned , and his 
tie under his ear , while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles . it 
hadn ' t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it . i only caught 
a glimpse of her at the moment , but she was a lovely woman , with a face that a 
man might die for . "' the church of st . monica , john ,' she cried , ' and 
half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes .' " this was quite too good to lose , 
watson . i was just balancing whether i should run for it , or whether i should perch behind her 
landau when a cab came through the street . the driver looked twice at such a shabby fare , but 
i jumped in before he could object . ' the church of st . monica ,' said i , ' 
and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes .' it was twenty - five minutes to twelve 
, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind . " my cabby drove fast . 
i don ' t think i ever drove faster , but the others were there before us . the cab 
and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when i arrived . i paid the 
man and hurried into the church . there was not a soul there save the two whom i had followed 
and a surpliced clergyman , who seemed to be expostulating with them . they were all three standing in a 
knot in front of the altar . i lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped 
into a church . suddenly , to my surprise , the three at the altar faced round to me , 
and godfrey norton came running as hard as he could towards me . "' thank god ,' he cried . 
' you ' ll do . come ! come !' "' what then ?' i asked . "' come , 
man , come , only three minutes , or it won ' t be legal .' " i was half 
- dragged up to the altar , and before i knew where i was i found myself mumbling responses which 
were whispered in my ear , and vouching for things of which i knew nothing , and generally assisting in 
the secure tying up of irene adler , spinster , to godfrey norton , bachelor . it was all done 
in an instant , and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the 
other , while the clergyman beamed on me in front . it was the most preposterous position in which i 
ever found myself in my life , and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now 
. it seems that there had been some informality about their license , that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry 
them without a witness of some sort , and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally 
out into the streets in search of a best man . the bride gave me a sovereign , and i 
mean to wear it on my watch - chain in memory of the occasion ." " this is a very 
unexpected turn of affairs ," said i ; " and what then ?" " well , i found my plans 
very seriously menaced . it looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure , and so necessitate very 
prompt and energetic measures on my part . at the church door , however , they separated , he driving 
back to the temple , and she to her own house . ' i shall drive out in the park 
at five as usual ,' she said as she left him . i heard no more . they drove away 
in different directions , and i went off to make my own arrangements ." " which are ?" " some 
cold beef and a glass of beer ," he answered , ringing the bell . " i have been too 
busy to think of food , and i am likely to be busier still this evening . by the way 
, doctor , i shall want your co - operation ." " i shall be delighted ." " you don 
' t mind breaking the law ?" " not in the least ." " nor running a chance of arrest 
?" " not in a good cause ." " oh , the cause is excellent !" " then i am 
your man ." " i was sure that i might rely on you ." " but what is it you 
wish ?" " when mrs . turner has brought in the tray i will make it clear to you . 
now ," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided , " i 
must discuss it while i eat , for i have not much time . it is nearly five now . 
in two hours we must be on the scene of action . miss irene , or madame , rather , 
returns from her drive at seven . we must be at briony lodge to meet her ." " and what 
then ?" " you must leave that to me . i have already arranged what is to occur . there 
is only one point on which i must insist . you must not interfere , come what may . you 
understand ?" " i am to be neutral ?" " to do nothing whatever . there will probably be some 
small unpleasantness . do not join in it . it will end in my being conveyed into the house . 
four or five minutes afterwards the sitting - room window will open . you are to station yourself close to 
that open window ." " yes ." " you are to watch me , for i will be visible to 
you ." " yes ." " and when i raise my hand -- so -- you will throw into the 
room what i give you to throw , and will , at the same time , raise the cry of 
fire . you quite follow me ?" " entirely ." " it is nothing very formidable ," he said , 
taking a long cigar - shaped roll from his pocket . " it is an ordinary plumber ' s smoke 
- rocket , fitted with a cap at either end to make it self - lighting . your task is 
confined to that . when you raise your cry of fire , it will be taken up by quite a 
number of people . you may then walk to the end of the street , and i will rejoin you 
in ten minutes . i hope that i have made myself clear ?" " i am to remain neutral , 
to get near the window , to watch you , and at the signal to throw in this object , 
then to raise the cry of fire , and to wait you at the corner of the street ." " 
precisely ." " then you may entirely rely on me ." " that is excellent . i think , perhaps 
, it is almost time that i prepare for the new role i have to play ." he disappeared into 
his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple - minded nonconformist clergyman 
. his broad black hat , his baggy trousers , his white tie , his sympathetic smile , and general 
look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as mr . john hare alone could have equalled . it was 
not merely that holmes changed his costume . his expression , his manner , his very soul seemed to vary 
with every fresh part that he assumed . the stage lost a fine actor , even as science lost an 
acute reasoner , when he became a specialist in crime . it was a quarter past six when we left 
baker street , and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in serpentine avenue . 
it was already dusk , and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front 
of briony lodge , waiting for the coming of its occupant . the house was just such as i had 
pictured it from sherlock holmes ' succinct description , but the locality appeared to be less private than i expected 
. on the contrary , for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood , it was remarkably animated . there 
was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner , a scissors - grinder with his 
wheel , two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse - girl , and several well - dressed young men 
who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths . " you see ," remarked holmes , as 
we paced to and fro in front of the house , " this marriage rather simplifies matters . the photograph 
becomes a double - edged weapon now . the chances are that she would be as averse to its being 
seen by mr . godfrey norton , as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess 
. now the question is , where are we to find the photograph ?" " where , indeed ?" " 
it is most unlikely that she carries it about with her . it is cabinet size . too large for 
easy concealment about a woman ' s dress . she knows that the king is capable of having her waylaid 
and searched . two attempts of the sort have already been made . we may take it , then , 
that she does not carry it about with her ." " where , then ?" " her banker or her 
lawyer . there is that double possibility . but i am inclined to think neither . women are naturally secretive 
, and they like to do their own secreting . why should she hand it over to anyone else ? 
she could trust her own guardianship , but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought 
to bear upon a business man . besides , remember that she had resolved to use it within a few 
days . it must be where she can lay her hands upon it . it must be in her own 
house ." " but it has twice been burgled ." " pshaw ! they did not know how to look 
." " but how will you look ?" " i will not look ." " what then ?" " i 
will get her to show me ." " but she will refuse ." " she will not be able to 
. but i hear the rumble of wheels . it is her carriage . now carry out my orders to 
the letter ." as he spoke the gleam of the side - lights of a carriage came round the curve 
of the avenue . it was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of briony lodge . 
as it pulled up , one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in 
the hope of earning a copper , but was elbowed away by another loafer , who had rushed up with 
the same intention . a fierce quarrel broke out , which was increased by the two guardsmen , who took 
sides with one of the loungers , and by the scissors - grinder , who was equally hot upon the 
other side . a blow was struck , and in an instant the lady , who had stepped from her 
carriage , was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men , who struck savagely at each 
other with their fists and sticks . holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady ; but just as 
he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground , with the blood running freely down his 
face . at his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other 
, while a number of better - dressed people , who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it 
, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man . irene adler , as i 
will still call her , had hurried up the steps ; but she stood at the top with her superb 
figure outlined against the lights of the hall , looking back into the street . " is the poor gentleman 
much hurt ?" she asked . " he is dead ," cried several voices . " no , no , 
there ' s life in him !" shouted another . " but he ' ll be gone before you can 
get him to hospital ." " he ' s a brave fellow ," said a woman . " they would 
have had the lady ' s purse and watch if it hadn ' t been for him . they were 
a gang , and a rough one , too . ah , he ' s breathing now ." " he 
can ' t lie in the street . may we bring him in , marm ?" " surely . bring 
him into the sitting - room . there is a comfortable sofa . this way , please !" slowly and 
solemnly he was borne into briony lodge and laid out in the principal room , while i still observed the 
proceedings from my post by the window . the lamps had been lit , but the blinds had not been 
drawn , so that i could see holmes as he lay upon the couch . i do not know whether 
he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing , but i know that i 
never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when i saw the beautiful creature against whom i 
was conspiring , or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man . and yet it 
would be the blackest treachery to holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me 
. i hardened my heart , and took the smoke - rocket from under my ulster . after all , 
i thought , we are not injuring her . we are but preventing her from injuring another . holmes had 
sat up upon the couch , and i saw him motion like a man who is in need of air 
. a maid rushed across and threw open the window . at the same instant i saw him raise his 
hand and at the signal i tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of " fire !" the 
word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators , well dressed and ill -- 
gentlemen , ostlers , and servant - maids -- joined in a general shriek of " fire !" thick clouds 
of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window . i caught a glimpse of rushing figures 
, and a moment later the voice of holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm . 
slipping through the shouting crowd i made my way to the corner of the street , and in ten minutes 
was rejoiced to find my friend ' s arm in mine , and to get away from the scene of 
uproar . he walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the 
quiet streets which lead towards the edgeware road . " you did it very nicely , doctor ," he remarked 
. " nothing could have been better . it is all right ." " you have the photograph ?" " 
i know where it is ." " and how did you find out ?" " she showed me , as 
i told you she would ." " i am still in the dark ." " i do not wish to 
make a mystery ," said he , laughing . " the matter was perfectly simple . you , of course 
, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice . they were all engaged for the evening ." " 
i guessed as much ." " then , when the row broke out , i had a little moist red 
paint in the palm of my hand . i rushed forward , fell down , clapped my hand to my 
face , and became a piteous spectacle . it is an old trick ." " that also i could fathom 
." " then they carried me in . she was bound to have me in . what else could she 
do ? and into her sitting - room , which was the very room which i suspected . it lay 
between that and her bedroom , and i was determined to see which . they laid me on a couch 
, i motioned for air , they were compelled to open the window , and you had your chance ." 
" how did that help you ?" " it was all - important . when a woman thinks that her 
house is on fire , her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most . 
it is a perfectly overpowering impulse , and i have more than once taken advantage of it . in the 
case of the darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me , and also in the arnsworth castle business 
. a married woman grabs at her baby ; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel - box . now 
it was clear to me that our lady of to - day had nothing in the house more precious to 
her than what we are in quest of . she would rush to secure it . the alarm of fire 
was admirably done . the smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel . she responded beautifully . 
the photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell - pull . she was 
there in an instant , and i caught a glimpse of it as she half - drew it out . 
when i cried out that it was a false alarm , she replaced it , glanced at the rocket , 
rushed from the room , and i have not seen her since . i rose , and , making my 
excuses , escaped from the house . i hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once ; but 
the coachman had come in , and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait . a 
little over - precipitance may ruin all ." " and now ?" i asked . " our quest is practically 
finished . i shall call with the king to - morrow , and with you , if you care to 
come with us . we will be shown into the sitting - room to wait for the lady , but 
it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph . it might be a 
satisfaction to his majesty to regain it with his own hands ." " and when will you call ?" " 
at eight in the morning . she will not be up , so that we shall have a clear field 
. besides , we must be prompt , for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and 
habits . i must wire to the king without delay ." we had reached baker street and had stopped at 
the door . he was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said : " good - night 
, mister sherlock holmes ." there were several people on the pavement at the time , but the greeting appeared 
to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by . " i ' ve heard that 
voice before ," said holmes , staring down the dimly lit street . " now , i wonder who the 
deuce that could have been ." iii . i slept at baker street that night , and we were engaged 
upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the king of bohemia rushed into the room . " you 
have really got it !" he cried , grasping sherlock holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face 
. " not yet ." " but you have hopes ?" " i have hopes ." " then , come 
. i am all impatience to be gone ." " we must have a cab ." " no , my 
brougham is waiting ." " then that will simplify matters ." we descended and started off once more for briony 
lodge . " irene adler is married ," remarked holmes . " married ! when ?" " yesterday ." " 
but to whom ?" " to an english lawyer named norton ." " but she could not love him ." 
" i am in hopes that she does ." " and why in hopes ?" " because it would spare 
your majesty all fear of future annoyance . if the lady loves her husband , she does not love your 
majesty . if she does not love your majesty , there is no reason why she should interfere with your 
majesty ' s plan ." " it is true . and yet -- well ! i wish she had been 
of my own station ! what a queen she would have made !" he relapsed into a moody silence , 
which was not broken until we drew up in serpentine avenue . the door of briony lodge was open , 
and an elderly woman stood upon the steps . she watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from 
the brougham . " mr . sherlock holmes , i believe ?" said she . " i am mr . 
holmes ," answered my companion , looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze . " indeed ! 
my mistress told me that you were likely to call . she left this morning with her husband by the 
5 : 15 train from charing cross for the continent ." " what !" sherlock holmes staggered back , white 
with chagrin and surprise . " do you mean that she has left england ?" " never to return ." 
" and the papers ?" asked the king hoarsely . " all is lost ." " we shall see ." 
he pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing - room , followed by the king and myself . 
the furniture was scattered about in every direction , with dismantled shelves and open drawers , as if the lady 
had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight . holmes rushed at the bell - pull , tore back a small 
sliding shutter , and , plunging in his hand , pulled out a photograph and a letter . the photograph 
was of irene adler herself in evening dress , the letter was superscribed to " sherlock holmes , esq . 
to be left till called for ." my friend tore it open and we all three read it together . 
it was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way : " my dear mr . 
sherlock holmes ,-- you really did it very well . you took me in completely . until after the alarm 
of fire , i had not a suspicion . but then , when i found how i had betrayed myself 
, i began to think . i had been warned against you months ago . i had been told that 
if the king employed an agent it would certainly be you . and your address had been given me . 
yet , with all this , you made me reveal what you wanted to know . even after i became 
suspicious , i found it hard to think evil of such a dear , kind old clergyman . but , 
you know , i have been trained as an actress myself . male costume is nothing new to me . 
i often take advantage of the freedom which it gives . i sent john , the coachman , to watch 
you , ran up stairs , got into my walking - clothes , as i call them , and came 
down just as you departed . " well , i followed you to your door , and so made sure 
that i was really an object of interest to the celebrated mr . sherlock holmes . then i , rather 
imprudently , wished you good - night , and started for the temple to see my husband . " we 
both thought the best resource was flight , when pursued by so formidable an antagonist ; so you will find 
the nest empty when you call to - morrow . as to the photograph , your client may rest in 
peace . i love and am loved by a better man than he . the king may do what he 
will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged . i keep it only to safeguard myself , and 
to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future . 
i leave a photograph which he might care to possess ; and i remain , dear mr . sherlock holmes 
, " very truly yours , " irene norton , nã © e adler ." " what a woman -- 
oh , what a woman !" cried the king of bohemia , when we had all three read this epistle 
. " did i not tell you how quick and resolute she was ? would she not have made an 
admirable queen ? is it not a pity that she was not on my level ?" " from what i 
have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your majesty ," said 
holmes coldly . " i am sorry that i have not been able to bring your majesty ' s business 
to a more successful conclusion ." " on the contrary , my dear sir ," cried the king ; " 
nothing could be more successful . i know that her word is inviolate . the photograph is now as safe 
as if it were in the fire ." " i am glad to hear your majesty say so ." " 
i am immensely indebted to you . pray tell me in what way i can reward you . this ring 
--" he <unk> an <unk> <unk> ring from his <unk> and <unk> it out upon the palm of his hand 
. " your majesty has something which i should <unk> even more <unk> ," said holmes . " you have 
but to name it ." " this photograph !" the king <unk> at him in <unk> . " irene ' 
s photograph !" he cried . " certainly , if you wish it ." " i thank your majesty . 
then there is no more to be done in the matter . i have the honour to wish you a 
very good - morning ." he <unk> , and , <unk> away without observing the hand which the king had 
stretched out to him , he <unk> off in my company for his chambers . and that was how a 
great scandal <unk> to <unk> the kingdom of bohemia , and how the best plans of mr . sherlock holmes 
were <unk> by a woman ' s <unk> . he <unk> to make <unk> over the <unk> of women , 
but i have not heard him do it of late . and when he <unk> of irene adler , or 
when he <unk> to her photograph , it is always under the <unk> title of the woman . adventure ii 
. the red - headed league i had called upon my friend , mr . sherlock holmes , one day 
in the <unk> of last year and found him in deep <unk> with a very <unk> , <unk> - faced 
, elderly gentleman with <unk> red <unk> . with an <unk> for my <unk> , i was about to <unk> 
when holmes pulled me <unk> into the room and <unk> the door behind me . " you could not <unk> 
have come at a better time , my dear watson ," he said <unk> . " i was <unk> that 
you were engaged ." " so i am . very much so ." " then i can wait in the 
next room ." " not at all . this gentleman , mr . <unk> , has been my <unk> and 
<unk> in many of my most successful cases , and i have no doubt that he will be of the 
<unk> use to me in yours also ." the <unk> gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a <unk> 
of greeting , with a quick little questioning glance from his small <unk> - <unk> eyes . " <unk> the 
<unk> ," said holmes , <unk> into his armchair and putting his <unk> together , as was his <unk> when 
in <unk> <unk> . " i know , my dear watson , that you <unk> my love of all that 
is <unk> and outside the <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> life . you have shown your <unk> for it 
by the <unk> which has <unk> you to chronicle , and , if you will excuse my <unk> so , 
<unk> to <unk> so many of my own little adventures ." " your cases have indeed been of the <unk> 
interest to me ," i observed . " you will remember that i remarked the other day , just before 
we went into the very simple problem <unk> by miss mary <unk> , that for strange <unk> and extraordinary <unk> 
we must go to life itself , which is always far more <unk> than any <unk> of the <unk> ." 
" a <unk> which i took the <unk> of <unk> ." " you did , doctor , but none the 
less you must come round to my view , for <unk> i shall keep on <unk> <unk> upon <unk> on 
you until your reason <unk> down under them and <unk> me to be right . now , mr . <unk> 
<unk> here has been good enough to call upon me this morning , and to begin a <unk> which promises 
to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time . you have heard me 
<unk> that the <unk> and most <unk> things are very often <unk> not with the <unk> but with the <unk> 
crimes , and occasionally , indeed , where there is room for doubt whether any <unk> crime has been committed 
. as far as i have heard it is <unk> for me to say whether the present case is an 
instance of crime or not , but the course of <unk> is certainly among the most singular that i have 
ever listened to . perhaps , mr . <unk> , you would have the great <unk> to <unk> your <unk> 
. i <unk> you not merely because my friend dr . watson has not heard the opening part but also 
because the peculiar nature of the story <unk> me <unk> to have every <unk> <unk> from your <unk> . as 
a <unk> , when i have heard some <unk> <unk> of the course of <unk> , i am able to 
<unk> myself by the <unk> of other <unk> cases which occur to my memory . in the present instance i 
am <unk> to admit that the facts are , to the best of my <unk> , <unk> ." the <unk> 
client <unk> out his chest with an appearance of some little <unk> and pulled a <unk> and <unk> <unk> from 
the inside pocket of his <unk> . as he glanced down the <unk> <unk> , with his head <unk> forward 
and the paper <unk> out upon his <unk> , i took a good look at the man and <unk> , 
after the fashion of my companion , to read the <unk> which might be <unk> by his dress or appearance 
. i did not <unk> very much , however , by my <unk> . our visitor bore every mark of 
being an <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and slow . he wore rather baggy <unk> <unk> 
' s <unk> trousers , a not over - <unk> black <unk> - coat , <unk> in the front , 
and a <unk> <unk> with a heavy <unk> <unk> chain , and a <unk> <unk> bit of <unk> <unk> down 
as an <unk> . a <unk> top - hat and a <unk> brown <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> lay 
upon a chair beside him . <unk> , look as i would , there was nothing remarkable about the man 
save his <unk> red head , and the expression of extreme chagrin and <unk> upon his features . sherlock holmes 
' quick eye took in my <unk> , and he <unk> his head with a smile as he <unk> my 
questioning <unk> . " beyond the <unk> facts that he has at some time done <unk> <unk> , that he 
<unk> <unk> , that he is a <unk> , that he has been in <unk> , and that he has 
done a <unk> <unk> of writing lately , i can deduce nothing else ." mr . <unk> <unk> started up 
in his chair , with his forefinger upon the paper , but his eyes upon my companion . " how 
, in the name of good - <unk> , did you know all that , mr . holmes ?" he 
asked . " how did you know , for example , that i did <unk> <unk> . it ' s 
as true as <unk> , for i began as a <unk> ' s <unk> ." " your hands , my 
dear sir . your right hand is quite a size <unk> than your left . you have <unk> with it 
, and the <unk> are more <unk> ." " well , the <unk> , then , and the freemasonry ?" 
" i won ' t <unk> your <unk> by <unk> you how i read that , <unk> as , rather 
against the strict <unk> of your order , you use an <unk> - and - <unk> <unk> ." " ah 
, of course , i <unk> that . but the writing ?" " what else can be indicated by that 
right <unk> so very <unk> for five inches , and the left one with the <unk> <unk> near the <unk> 
where you rest it upon the <unk> ?" " well , but <unk> ?" " the <unk> that you have 
<unk> immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in <unk> . i have made a small study 
of <unk> <unk> and have even <unk> to the <unk> of the subject . that trick of <unk> the fishes 
' <unk> of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to <unk> . when , in <unk> , i see a 
<unk> <unk> hanging from your watch - chain , the matter becomes even more simple ." mr . <unk> <unk> 
laughed <unk> . " well , i never !" said he . " i thought at first that you had 
done something <unk> , but i see that there was nothing in it , after all ." " i begin 
to think , watson ," said holmes , " that i make a mistake in <unk> . ' <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> ,' you know , and my poor little <unk> , such as it is , will <unk> <unk> 
if i am so <unk> . can you not find the <unk> , mr . <unk> ?" " yes , 
i have got it now ," he answered with his thick red <unk> <unk> halfway down the <unk> . " 
here it is . this is what began it all . you just read it for yourself , sir ." 
i took the paper from him and read as <unk> : " to the red - headed league : on 
account of the <unk> of the late <unk> <unk> , of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . s . a 
<unk> there is now another <unk> open which <unk> a member of the league to a <unk> of <unk> pounds 
a week for <unk> <unk> services . all red - headed men who are sound in <unk> and mind and 
above the <unk> of twenty - one years , are <unk> . <unk> in person on monday , at <unk> 
o ' clock , to <unk> <unk> , at the <unk> of the league , <unk> <unk> ' s <unk> 
, <unk> street ." " what on <unk> does this mean ?" i <unk> after i had twice read over 
the extraordinary <unk> . holmes chuckled and <unk> in his chair , as was his habit when in high <unk> 
. " it is a little off the <unk> <unk> , <unk> ' t it ?" said he . " 
and now , mr . <unk> , off you go at <unk> and tell us all about yourself , your 
<unk> , and the <unk> which this <unk> had upon your <unk> . you will first make a note , 
doctor , of the paper and the date ." " it is the morning chronicle of april <unk> , <unk> 
. just two months ago ." " very good . now , mr . <unk> ?" " well , it 
is just as i have been <unk> you , mr . sherlock holmes ," said <unk> <unk> , <unk> his 
forehead ; " i have a small <unk> ' s business at <unk> <unk> , near the <unk> . it 
' s not a very large <unk> , and of late years it has not done more than just give 
me a living . i <unk> to be able to keep two <unk> , but now i only keep one 
; and i would have a <unk> to pay him but that he is <unk> to come for half <unk> 
so as to <unk> the business ." " what is the name of this <unk> youth ?" asked sherlock holmes 
. " his name is <unk> <unk> , and he ' s not such a youth , either . it 
' s hard to say his <unk> . i should not wish a <unk> <unk> , mr . holmes ; 
and i know very well that he could better himself and <unk> twice what i am able to give him 
. but , after all , if he is <unk> , why should i put <unk> in his head ?" 
" why , indeed ? you <unk> most fortunate in having an <unk> © who comes under the <unk> <unk> 
<unk> . it is not a <unk> <unk> among <unk> in this <unk> . i don ' t know that 
your <unk> is not as remarkable as your <unk> ." " oh , he has his <unk> , too ," 
said mr . <unk> . " never was such a fellow for <unk> . <unk> away with a <unk> when 
he <unk> to be <unk> his mind , and then <unk> down into the <unk> like a <unk> into its 
<unk> to <unk> his <unk> . that is his <unk> <unk> , but on the whole he ' s a 
good <unk> . there ' s no <unk> in him ." " he is still with you , i <unk> 
?" " yes , sir . he and a girl of <unk> , who does a bit of simple <unk> 
and <unk> the <unk> <unk> -- that ' s all i have in the house , for i am a 
<unk> and never had any family . we <unk> very quietly , sir , the three of us ; and 
we keep a <unk> over our heads and pay our <unk> , if we do nothing more . " the 
first thing that put us out was that <unk> . <unk> , he came down into the <unk> just this 
day eight <unk> , with this very paper in his hand , and he <unk> : "' i wish to 
the <unk> , mr . <unk> , that i was a red - headed man .' "' why that ?' 
i <unk> . "' why ,' <unk> he , ' here ' s another <unk> on the league of the 
red - headed men . it ' s <unk> quite a little <unk> to any man who <unk> it , 
and i understand that there are more <unk> than there are men , so that the <unk> are at their 
<unk> ' end what to do with the money . if my <unk> would only change <unk> , here ' 
s a nice little <unk> all <unk> for me to step into .' "' why , what is it , 
then ?' i asked . you see , mr . holmes , i am a very stay - at - 
home man , and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it , i 
was often <unk> on end without putting my <unk> over the door - <unk> . in that way i <unk> 
' t know much of what was <unk> on outside , and i was always glad of a bit of 
news . "' have you never heard of the league of the red - headed men ?' he asked with 
his eyes open . "' never .' "' why , i wonder at that , for you are <unk> yourself 
for one of the <unk> .' "' and what are they <unk> ?' i asked . "' oh , merely 
a <unk> of hundred a year , but the work is <unk> , and it need not interfere very much 
with one ' s other <unk> .' " well , you can easily think that that made me <unk> up 
my <unk> , for the business has not been over - good for some years , and an <unk> <unk> 
of hundred would have been very <unk> . "' tell me all about it ,' said i . "' well 
,' said he , showing me the <unk> , ' you can see for yourself that the league has a 
<unk> , and there is the address where you should <unk> for <unk> . as far as i can make 
out , the league was <unk> by an <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who was very peculiar in his 
<unk> . he was himself red - headed , and he had a great sympathy for all red - headed 
men ; so when he <unk> it was found that he had left his <unk> <unk> in the hands of 
<unk> , with <unk> to <unk> the interest to the <unk> of easy <unk> to men whose <unk> is of 
that <unk> . from all i hear it is <unk> pay and very little to do .' "' but ,' 
said i , ' there would be <unk> of red - headed men who would <unk> .' "' not so 
many as you might think ,' he answered . ' you see it is really confined to <unk> , and 
to <unk> men . this <unk> had started from london when he was young , and he wanted to do 
the old <unk> a good turn . then , again , i have heard it is no use your <unk> 
if your <unk> is light red , or dark red , or anything but <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> 
red . now , if you <unk> to <unk> , mr . <unk> , you would just walk in ; 
but perhaps it would hardly be <unk> your while to put yourself out of the way for the <unk> of 
a few hundred pounds .' " now , it is a <unk> , gentlemen , as you may see for 
<unk> , that my <unk> is of a very <unk> and rich <unk> , so that it seemed to me 
that if there was to be any <unk> in the matter i stood as good a chance as any man 
that i had ever <unk> . <unk> <unk> seemed to know so much about it that i thought he might 
prove <unk> , so i just <unk> him to put up the <unk> for the day and to come right 
away with me . he was very <unk> to have a <unk> , so we <unk> the business up and 
started off for the address that was given us in the <unk> . " i never hope to see such 
a <unk> as that again , mr . holmes . from <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> every 
man who had a <unk> of red in his <unk> had <unk> into the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . 
<unk> street was choked with red - headed <unk> , and <unk> ' s <unk> looked like a <unk> ' 
s orange <unk> . i should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought 
together by that single <unk> . every <unk> of <unk> they were -- <unk> , <unk> , orange , <unk> 
, <unk> - <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ; but , as <unk> said , there were not many who 
had the <unk> <unk> flame - coloured <unk> . when i saw how many were waiting , i would have 
given it up in <unk> ; but <unk> would not hear of it . how he did it i could 
not imagine , but he pushed and pulled and <unk> until he got me through the crowd , and right 
up to the steps which led to the <unk> . there was a double <unk> upon the <unk> , some 
<unk> up in hope , and some coming back <unk> ; but we <unk> in as well as we could 
and soon found ourselves in the <unk> ." " your <unk> has been a most <unk> one ," remarked holmes 
as his client paused and <unk> his memory with a <unk> <unk> of <unk> . " pray continue your very 
interesting <unk> ." " there was nothing in the <unk> but a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and a deal table 
, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even <unk> than mine . he said a 
few <unk> to each <unk> as he came up , and then he always <unk> to find some <unk> in 
them which would <unk> them . getting a <unk> did not <unk> to be such a very easy matter , 
after all . however , when our turn came the little man was much more <unk> to me than to 
any of the others , and he <unk> the door as we entered , so that he might have a 
private word with us . "' this is mr . <unk> <unk> ,' said my <unk> , ' and he 
is <unk> to <unk> a <unk> in the league .' "' and he is admirably suited for it ,' the 
other answered . ' he has every <unk> . i <unk> <unk> when i have seen anything so fine .' 
he took a step <unk> , <unk> his head on one side , and <unk> at my <unk> until i 
felt quite <unk> . then suddenly he <unk> forward , <unk> my hand , and <unk> me <unk> on my 
success . "' it would be <unk> to <unk> ,' said he . ' you will , however , i 
am sure , excuse me for taking an <unk> precaution .' with that he seized my <unk> in both his 
hands , and <unk> until i <unk> with the <unk> . ' there is <unk> in your eyes ,' said 
he as he <unk> me . ' i <unk> that all is as it should be . but we have 
to be <unk> , for we have twice been <unk> by <unk> and once by paint . i could tell 
you <unk> of <unk> ' s <unk> which would <unk> you with <unk> nature .' he stepped over to the 
window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the <unk> was <unk> . a <unk> of 
<unk> came up from <unk> , and the <unk> all <unk> away in different directions until there was not a 
red - head to be seen except my own and that of the <unk> . "' my name ,' said 
he , ' is mr . <unk> <unk> , and i am myself one of the <unk> upon the <unk> 
left by our noble <unk> . are you a married man , mr . <unk> ? have you a family 
?' " i answered that i had not . " his face fell immediately . "' dear me !' he 
said <unk> , ' that is very serious indeed ! i am sorry to hear you say that . the 
<unk> was , of course , for the <unk> and <unk> of the red - heads as well as for 
their <unk> . it is <unk> <unk> that you should be a bachelor .' " my face <unk> at this 
, mr . holmes , for i thought that i was not to have the <unk> after all ; but 
after <unk> it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right . "' in the 
case of another ,' said he , ' the <unk> might be <unk> , but we must <unk> a point 
in <unk> of a man with such a head of <unk> as yours . when shall you be able to 
enter upon your new <unk> ?' "' well , it is a little <unk> , for i have a business 
already ,' said i . "' oh , never mind about that , mr . <unk> !' said <unk> <unk> 
. ' i should be able to look after that for you .' "' what would be the hours ?' 
i asked . "' ten to two .' " now a <unk> ' s business is <unk> done of an 
evening , mr . holmes , <unk> thursday and <unk> evening , which is just before pay - day ; 
so it would suit me very well to <unk> a little in the <unk> . besides , i knew that 
my <unk> was a good man , and that he would see to anything that turned up . "' that 
would suit me very well ,' said i . ' and the pay ?' "' is <unk> pounds a week 
.' "' and the work ?' "' is <unk> <unk> .' "' what do you call <unk> <unk> ?' "' 
well , you have to be in the <unk> , or at least in the <unk> , the whole time 
. if you leave , you <unk> your whole position <unk> . the will is very clear upon that point 
. you don ' t <unk> with the <unk> if you <unk> from the <unk> during that time .' "' 
it ' s only four hours a day , and i should not think of <unk> ,' said i . 
"' no excuse will <unk> ,' said mr . <unk> <unk> ; ' neither <unk> nor business nor anything else 
. there you must stay , or you lose your <unk> .' "' and the work ?' "' is to 
copy out the " <unk> <unk> ." there is the first volume of it in that press . you must 
find your own <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> - paper , but we <unk> this table and chair . 
will you be <unk> to - morrow ?' "' certainly ,' i answered . "' then , good - <unk> 
, mr . <unk> <unk> , and let me <unk> you once more on the important position which you have 
been fortunate enough to <unk> .' he <unk> me out of the room and i went home with my <unk> 
, hardly <unk> what to say or do , i was so <unk> at my own good <unk> . " 
well , i thought over the matter all day , and by evening i was in <unk> <unk> again ; 
for i had quite <unk> myself that the whole <unk> must be some great <unk> or <unk> , though what 
its object might be i could not imagine . it seemed <unk> past <unk> that anyone could make such a 
will , or that they would pay such a <unk> for doing anything so simple as <unk> out the ' 
<unk> <unk> .' <unk> <unk> did what he could to <unk> me up , but by <unk> i had <unk> 
myself out of the whole thing . however , in the morning i determined to have a look at it 
<unk> , so i bought a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and with a <unk> - <unk> , and seven 
<unk> of <unk> paper , i started off for <unk> ' s <unk> . " well , to my surprise 
and <unk> , <unk> was as right as <unk> . the table was <unk> out <unk> for me , and 
mr . <unk> <unk> was there to see that i got <unk> to work . he started me off upon 
the letter a , and then he left me ; but he would drop in from time to time to 
see that all was right with me . at two o ' clock he <unk> me good - day , 
<unk> me upon the <unk> that i had written , and <unk> the door of the <unk> after me . 
" this went on day after day , mr . holmes , and on <unk> the <unk> came in and 
<unk> down four <unk> <unk> for my week ' s work . it was the same next week , and 
the same the week after . every morning i was there at ten , and every afternoon i left at 
two . by <unk> mr . <unk> <unk> took to coming in only once of a morning , and then 
, after a time , he did not come in at all . still , of course , i never 
<unk> to leave the room for an instant , for i was not sure when he might come , and 
the <unk> was such a good one , and suited me so well , that i would not <unk> the 
<unk> of it . " eight <unk> passed away like this , and i had written about <unk> and <unk> 
and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> with <unk> that i might get on to the <unk> ' 
s before very long . it cost me something in <unk> , and i had pretty nearly <unk> a <unk> 
with my <unk> . and then suddenly the whole business came to an end ." " to an end ?" 
" yes , sir . and no later than this morning . i went to my work as usual at 
ten o ' clock , but the door was <unk> and <unk> , with a little <unk> of <unk> <unk> 
on to the <unk> of the panel with a <unk> . here it is , and you can read for 
yourself ." he <unk> up a <unk> of white <unk> about the size of a sheet of note - paper 
. it read in this fashion : the red - headed league is <unk> . <unk> <unk> , <unk> . 
sherlock holmes and i <unk> this <unk> <unk> and the <unk> face behind it , until the <unk> side of 
the <unk> so completely <unk> every other <unk> that we both <unk> out into a <unk> of <unk> . " 
i <unk> see that there is anything very funny ," cried our client , <unk> up to the <unk> of 
his flaming head . " if you can do nothing better than <unk> at me , i can go <unk> 
." " no , no ," cried holmes , <unk> him back into the chair from which he had half 
risen . " i really <unk> ' t miss your case for the world . it is most <unk> unusual 
. but there is , if you will excuse my <unk> so , something just a little funny about it 
. pray what steps did you take when you found the <unk> upon the door ?" " i was staggered 
, sir . i did not know what to do . then i called at the <unk> round , but 
none of them seemed to know anything about it . finally , i went to the <unk> , who is 
an <unk> living on the ground - floor , and i asked him if he could tell me what had 
<unk> of the red - headed league . he said that he had never heard of any such <unk> . 
then i asked him who mr . <unk> <unk> was . he answered that the name was new to him 
. "' well ,' said i , ' the gentleman at no . <unk> .' "' what , the red 
- headed man ?' "' yes .' "' oh ,' said he , ' his name was <unk> <unk> . 
he was a <unk> and was <unk> my room as a <unk> <unk> until his new <unk> were <unk> . 
he <unk> out yesterday .' "' where could i find him ?' "' oh , at his new <unk> . 
he did tell me the address . yes , <unk> king <unk> street , near st . <unk> ' s 
.' " i started off , mr . holmes , but when i got to that address it was a 
<unk> of <unk> <unk> - <unk> , and no one in it had ever heard of either mr . <unk> 
<unk> or mr . <unk> <unk> ." " and what did you do then ?" asked holmes . " i 
went home to saxe - <unk> <unk> , and i took the <unk> of my <unk> . but he could 
not help me in any way . he could only say that if i waited i should hear by post 
. but that was not quite good enough , mr . holmes . i did not wish to lose such 
a <unk> without a <unk> , so , as i had heard that you were good enough to give <unk> 
to poor <unk> who were in need of it , i came right away to you ." " and you 
did very <unk> ," said holmes . " your case is an <unk> remarkable one , and i shall be 
<unk> to look into it . from what you have told me i think that it is <unk> that <unk> 
<unk> <unk> from it than might at first <unk> <unk> ." " <unk> enough !" said mr . <unk> <unk> 
. " why , i have lost four <unk> a week ." " as far as you are <unk> <unk> 
," remarked holmes , " i do not see that you have any <unk> against this extraordinary league . on 
the contrary , you are , as i understand , <unk> by some <unk> pounds , to say nothing of 
the <unk> <unk> which you have <unk> on every subject which comes under the letter a . you have lost 
nothing by them ." " no , sir . but i want to find out about them , and who 
they are , and what their object was in playing this <unk> -- if it was a <unk> -- upon 
me . it was a pretty <unk> <unk> for them , for it cost them two and thirty pounds ." 
" we shall <unk> to clear up these <unk> for you . and , first , one or two <unk> 
, mr . <unk> . this <unk> of yours who first called your attention to the <unk> -- how long 
had he been with you ?" " about a <unk> then ." " how did he come ?" " in 
<unk> to an <unk> ." " was he the only <unk> ?" " no , i had a dozen ." 
" why did you <unk> him ?" " because he was <unk> and would come <unk> ." " at half 
- <unk> , in <unk> ." " yes ." " what is he like , this <unk> <unk> ?" " 
small , <unk> - built , very quick in his <unk> , no <unk> on his face , though he 
' s not <unk> of thirty . has a white <unk> of <unk> upon his forehead ." holmes sat up 
in his chair in <unk> <unk> . " i thought as much ," said he . " have you ever 
observed that his <unk> are <unk> for <unk> ?" " yes , sir . he told me that a <unk> 
had done it for him when he was a <unk> ." " hum !" said holmes , <unk> back in 
deep thought . " he is still with you ?" " oh , yes , sir ; i have only 
just left him ." " and has your business been <unk> to in your <unk> ?" " nothing to <unk> 
of , sir . there ' s never very much to do of a morning ." " that will do 
, mr . <unk> . i shall be <unk> to give you an <unk> upon the subject in the course 
of a day or two . to - day is <unk> , and i hope that by monday we may 
come to a conclusion ." " well , watson ," said holmes when our visitor had left us , " 
what do you make of it all ?" " i make nothing of it ," i answered <unk> . " 
it is a most <unk> business ." " as a <unk> ," said holmes , " the more <unk> a 
thing is the less <unk> it <unk> to be . it is your <unk> , <unk> crimes which are really 
<unk> , just as a <unk> face is the most difficult to <unk> . but i must be prompt over 
this matter ." " what are you <unk> to do , then ?" i asked . " to smoke ," 
he answered . " it is quite a three <unk> problem , and i <unk> that you won ' t 
speak to me for fifty minutes ." he curled himself up in his chair , with his <unk> <unk> drawn 
up to his <unk> - like <unk> , and there he sat with his eyes <unk> and his black <unk> 
<unk> <unk> out like the <unk> of some strange <unk> . i had come to the conclusion that he had 
dropped <unk> , and indeed was <unk> myself , when he suddenly sprang out of his chair with the gesture 
of a man who has made up his mind and put his <unk> down upon the <unk> . " <unk> 
<unk> at the st . <unk> ' s hall this afternoon ," he remarked . " what do you think 
, watson ? could your <unk> spare you for a few hours ?" " i have nothing to do to 
- day . my practice is never very <unk> ." " then put on your hat and come . i 
am <unk> through the <unk> first , and we can have some <unk> on the way . i observe that 
there is a good deal of german <unk> on the <unk> , which is rather more to my taste than 
<unk> or <unk> . it is introspective , and i want to <unk> . come <unk> !" we travelled by 
the <unk> as far as <unk> ; and a <unk> walk took us to saxe - <unk> <unk> , the 
scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning . it was a <unk> , little 
, shabby - <unk> <unk> , where four <unk> of <unk> two - <unk> <unk> houses looked out into a 
small <unk> - in <unk> , where a <unk> of <unk> <unk> and a few <unk> of <unk> <unk> - 
<unk> made a hard <unk> against a smoke - <unk> and <unk> <unk> . three <unk> <unk> and a brown 
<unk> with " <unk> <unk> " in white letters , upon a corner house , <unk> the <unk> where our 
red - headed client carried on his business . sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on 
one side and looked it all over , with his eyes <unk> <unk> between <unk> <unk> . then he walked 
slowly up the street , and then down again to the corner , still looking <unk> at the houses . 
finally he returned to the <unk> ' s , and , having <unk> <unk> upon the pavement with his <unk> 
two or three times , he went up to the door and <unk> . it was <unk> opened by a 
<unk> - looking , <unk> - <unk> young fellow , who asked him to step in . " thank you 
," said holmes , " i only wished to <unk> you how you would go from here to the <unk> 
." " <unk> right , <unk> left ," answered the <unk> <unk> , closing the door . " smart fellow 
, that ," observed holmes as we walked away . " he is , in my <unk> , the <unk> 
<unk> man in london , and for <unk> i am not sure that he has not a <unk> to be 
<unk> . i have known something of him before ." " evidently ," said i , " mr . <unk> 
' s <unk> <unk> for a good deal in this mystery of the red - headed league . i am 
sure that you <unk> your way merely in order that you might see him ." " not him ." " 
what then ?" " the <unk> of his trousers ." " and what did you see ?" " what i 
expected to see ." " why did you <unk> the pavement ?" " my dear doctor , this is a 
time for observation , not for <unk> . we are <unk> in an <unk> ' s country . we know 
something of saxe - <unk> <unk> . let us now <unk> the <unk> which lie behind it ." the road 
in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired saxe - <unk> <unk> <unk> as 
great a <unk> to it as the front of a <unk> does to the back . it was one of 
the <unk> <unk> which conveyed the <unk> of the <unk> to the <unk> and <unk> . the <unk> was <unk> 
with the immense <unk> of <unk> <unk> in a double <unk> <unk> and <unk> , while the <unk> were black 
with the <unk> <unk> of <unk> . it was difficult to <unk> as we looked at the line of fine 
<unk> and <unk> business <unk> that they really <unk> on the other side upon the <unk> and <unk> <unk> which 
we had just <unk> . " let me see ," said holmes , standing at the corner and glancing <unk> 
the line , " i should like just to remember the order of the houses here . it is a 
<unk> of mine to have an <unk> <unk> of london . there is <unk> ' s , the <unk> , 
the little <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and 
<unk> ' s carriage - <unk> <unk> . that carries us right on to the other <unk> . and now 
, doctor , we ' ve done our work , so it ' s time we had some play . 
a <unk> and a <unk> of coffee , and then off to <unk> - <unk> , where all is <unk> 
and delicacy and <unk> , and there are no red - headed <unk> to <unk> us with their <unk> ." 
my friend was an <unk> <unk> , being himself not only a very capable <unk> but a <unk> of no 
ordinary <unk> . all the afternoon he sat in the <unk> <unk> in the most perfect happiness , <unk> waving 
his long , <unk> <unk> in time to the <unk> , while his <unk> <unk> face and his languid , 
<unk> eyes were as <unk> those of holmes the <unk> - <unk> , holmes the <unk> , keen - <unk> 
, <unk> - handed <unk> agent , as it was <unk> to <unk> . in his singular character the <unk> 
nature <unk> <unk> itself , and his extreme <unk> and <unk> <unk> , as i have often thought , the 
<unk> against the <unk> and <unk> mood which occasionally <unk> in him . the <unk> of his nature took him 
from extreme <unk> to <unk> energy ; and , as i knew well , he was never so truly formidable 
as when , for days on end , he had been lounging in his armchair <unk> his <unk> and his 
black - letter <unk> . then it was that the <unk> of the <unk> would suddenly come upon him , 
and that his <unk> reasoning power would rise to the level of <unk> , until those who were <unk> with 
his methods would look <unk> at him as on a man whose <unk> was not that of other <unk> . 
when i saw him that afternoon so <unk> in the <unk> at st . <unk> ' s hall i felt 
that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had <unk> himself to <unk> down . " you 
want to go home , no doubt , doctor ," he remarked as we emerged . " yes , it 
would be as well ." " and i have some business to do which will take some hours . this 
business at <unk> <unk> is serious ." " why serious ?" " a <unk> crime is in <unk> . i 
have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to <unk> it . but to - day being 
<unk> rather <unk> matters . i shall want your help to - night ." " at what time ?" " 
ten will be <unk> enough ." " i shall be at baker street at ten ." " very well . 
and , i say , doctor , there may be some little <unk> , so kindly put your <unk> <unk> 
in your pocket ." he waved his hand , turned on his <unk> , and disappeared in an instant among 
the crowd . i trust that i am not more <unk> than my <unk> , but i was always <unk> 
with a <unk> of my own <unk> in my <unk> with sherlock holmes . here i had heard what he 
had heard , i had seen what he had seen , and yet from his <unk> it was <unk> that 
he saw <unk> not only what had <unk> but what was about to <unk> , while to me the whole 
business was still <unk> and <unk> . as i drove home to my house in <unk> i thought over it 
all , from the extraordinary story of the red - headed <unk> of the " <unk> " down to the 
visit to saxe - <unk> <unk> , and the ominous <unk> with which he had <unk> from me . what 
was this <unk> <unk> , and why should i go <unk> ? where were we <unk> , and what were 
we to do ? i had the <unk> from holmes that this <unk> - faced <unk> ' s <unk> was 
a formidable man -- a man who might play a deep <unk> . i tried to <unk> it out , 
but gave it up in <unk> and <unk> the matter <unk> until night should bring an <unk> . it was 
a quarter - past <unk> when i started from home and made my way across the park , and so 
through <unk> street to baker street . two <unk> were standing at the door , and as i entered the 
passage i heard the sound of voices from above . on <unk> his room i found holmes in animated <unk> 
with two men , one of whom i <unk> as <unk> <unk> , the official police agent , while the 
other was a long , <unk> , <unk> - faced man , with a very <unk> hat and <unk> respectable 
<unk> - coat . " ha ! our <unk> is complete ," said holmes , <unk> up his <unk> - 
<unk> and taking his heavy <unk> <unk> from the <unk> . " watson , i think you know mr . 
<unk> , of <unk> <unk> ? let me introduce you to mr . <unk> , who is to be our 
companion in to - night ' s adventure ." " we ' re <unk> in <unk> again , doctor , 
you see ," said <unk> in his <unk> way . " our friend here is a wonderful man for <unk> 
a <unk> . all he <unk> is an old <unk> to help him to do the running down ." " 
i hope a <unk> <unk> may not prove to be the end of our <unk> ," observed mr . <unk> 
<unk> . " you may <unk> <unk> <unk> in mr . holmes , sir ," said the police agent <unk> 
. " he has his own little methods , which are , if he won ' t mind my <unk> 
so , just a little too <unk> and <unk> , but he has the <unk> of a <unk> in him 
. it is not too much to say that once or twice , as in that business of the <unk> 
murder and the <unk> <unk> , he has been more nearly <unk> than the official <unk> ." " oh , 
if you say so , mr . <unk> , it is all right ," said the <unk> with <unk> . 
" still , i confess that i miss my <unk> . it is the first <unk> night for seven - 
and - twenty years that i have not had my <unk> ." " i think you will find ," said 
sherlock holmes , " that you will play for a <unk> <unk> to - night than you have ever done 
yet , and that the play will be more <unk> . for you , mr . <unk> , the <unk> 
will be some <unk> , <unk> pounds ; and for you , <unk> , it will be the man upon 
whom you wish to lay your hands ." " john <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and 
<unk> . he ' s a young man , mr . <unk> , but he is at the head of 
his profession , and i would rather have my <unk> on him than on any <unk> in london . he 
' s a remarkable man , is young john <unk> . his <unk> was a royal duke , and he 
himself has been to <unk> and <unk> . his <unk> is as <unk> as his <unk> , and though we 
meet signs of him at every turn , we never know where to find the man himself . he ' 
ll crack a <unk> in <unk> one week , and be <unk> money to <unk> an <unk> in <unk> the 
next . i ' ve been on his <unk> for years and have never <unk> eyes on him yet ." 
" i hope that i may have the pleasure of <unk> you to - night . i ' ve had 
one or two little <unk> also with mr . john <unk> , and i <unk> with you that he is 
at the head of his profession . it is past ten , however , and quite time that we started 
. if you two will take the first hansom , watson and i will follow in the second ." sherlock 
holmes was not very <unk> during the long drive and lay back in the cab <unk> the <unk> which he 
had heard in the afternoon . we rattled through an <unk> <unk> of <unk> - lit streets until we emerged 
into <unk> street . " we are close there now ," my friend remarked . " this fellow <unk> is 
a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> interested in the matter . i thought it as well to have <unk> with 
us also . he is not a bad fellow , though an absolute <unk> in his profession . he has 
one <unk> <unk> . he is as brave as a <unk> and as <unk> as a <unk> if he <unk> 
his <unk> upon anyone . here we are , and they are waiting for us ." we had reached the 
same crowded <unk> in which we had found ourselves in the morning . our <unk> were <unk> , and , 
following the <unk> of mr . <unk> , we passed down a <unk> passage and through a side door , 
which he opened for us . within there was a small <unk> , which ended in a very <unk> <unk> 
<unk> . this also was opened , and led down a flight of <unk> <unk> steps , which <unk> at 
another formidable <unk> . mr . <unk> stopped to light a <unk> , and then <unk> us down a dark 
, <unk> - smelling passage , and so , after opening a <unk> door , into a <unk> <unk> or 
<unk> , which was <unk> all round with <unk> and <unk> <unk> . " you are not very <unk> from 
above ," holmes remarked as he <unk> up the <unk> and <unk> about him . " nor from <unk> ," 
said mr . <unk> , <unk> his <unk> upon the <unk> which lined the floor . " why , dear 
me , it <unk> quite <unk> !" he remarked , looking up in surprise . " i must really <unk> 
you to be a little more quiet !" said holmes <unk> . " you have already <unk> the whole success 
of our <unk> . might i <unk> that you would have the <unk> to sit down upon one of those 
<unk> , and not to interfere ?" the <unk> mr . <unk> <unk> himself upon a <unk> , with a 
very injured expression upon his face , while holmes fell upon his <unk> upon the floor and , with the 
<unk> and a <unk> <unk> , began to <unk> <unk> the <unk> between the <unk> . a few <unk> <unk> 
to <unk> him , for he sprang to his feet again and put his glass in his pocket . " 
we have at least an hour before us ," he remarked , " for they can hardly take any steps 
until the good <unk> is safely in <unk> . then they will not lose a <unk> , for the sooner 
they do their work the <unk> time they will have for their <unk> . we are at present , doctor 
-- as no doubt you have <unk> -- in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of one of the principal 
london <unk> . mr . <unk> is the <unk> of <unk> , and he will explain to you that there 
are reasons why the more <unk> <unk> of london should take a <unk> interest in this <unk> at present ." 
" it is our <unk> gold ," whispered the <unk> . " we have had several <unk> that an attempt 
might be made upon it ." " your <unk> gold ?" " yes . we had occasion some months ago 
to <unk> our <unk> and <unk> for that purpose <unk> , <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> . it 
has <unk> known that we have never had occasion to <unk> the money , and that it is still lying 
in our <unk> . the <unk> upon which i sit <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> between <unk> of lead 
<unk> . our <unk> of <unk> is much <unk> at present than is <unk> <unk> in a single <unk> <unk> 
, and the <unk> have had <unk> upon the subject ." " which were very well <unk> ," observed holmes 
. " and now it is time that we arranged our little plans . i <unk> that within an hour 
matters will come to a head . in the <unk> mr . <unk> , we must put the <unk> over 
that dark <unk> ." " and sit in the dark ?" " i am <unk> so . i had brought 
a <unk> of <unk> in my pocket , and i thought that , as we were a <unk> <unk> © 
e , you might have your <unk> after all . but i see that the <unk> ' s <unk> have 
gone so far that we <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a light . and , first of all , we 
must <unk> our <unk> . these are <unk> men , and though we shall take them at a <unk> , 
they may do us some <unk> <unk> we are <unk> . i shall <unk> behind this <unk> , and do 
you conceal <unk> behind those . then , when i <unk> a light upon them , close in swiftly . 
if they fire , watson , have no compunction about <unk> them down ." i placed my <unk> , <unk> 
, upon the top of the <unk> case behind which i <unk> . holmes shot the <unk> across the front 
of his <unk> and left us in <unk> <unk> -- such an absolute <unk> as i have never before <unk> 
. the <unk> of hot <unk> remained to <unk> us that the light was still there , <unk> to <unk> 
out at a moment ' s notice . to me , with my nerves <unk> up to a <unk> of 
<unk> , there was something <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> <unk> , and in the cold <unk> air of 
the <unk> . " they have but one <unk> ," whispered holmes . " that is back through the house 
into saxe - <unk> <unk> . i hope that you have done what i asked you , <unk> ?" " 
i have an <unk> and two <unk> waiting at the front door ." " then we have stopped all the 
<unk> . and now we must be <unk> and wait ." what a time it seemed ! from <unk> notes 
afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter , yet it appeared to me that the night must have 
almost gone and the <unk> be breaking above us . my limbs were <unk> and stiff , for i <unk> 
to change my position ; yet my nerves were <unk> up to the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and my 
<unk> was so acute that i could not only hear the <unk> breathing of my <unk> , but i could 
<unk> the <unk> , <unk> in - <unk> of the <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> note of the 
<unk> <unk> . from my position i could look over the case in the direction of the floor . suddenly 
my eyes caught the <unk> of a light . at first it was but a <unk> <unk> upon the <unk> 
pavement . then it <unk> out until it became a <unk> line , and then , without any <unk> or 
sound , a <unk> seemed to open and a hand appeared , a white , almost <unk> hand , which 
felt about in the centre of the little <unk> of light . for a <unk> or more the hand , 
with its <unk> <unk> , <unk> out of the floor . then it was <unk> as suddenly as it appeared 
, and all was dark again save the single <unk> <unk> which marked a <unk> between the <unk> . its 
<unk> , however , was but <unk> . with a <unk> , <unk> sound , one of the broad , 
white <unk> turned over upon its side and left a <unk> , <unk> <unk> , through which <unk> the light 
of a <unk> . over the <unk> there <unk> a <unk> - <unk> , <unk> face , which looked <unk> 
about it , and then , with a hand on either side of the <unk> , drew itself shoulder - 
high and <unk> - high , until one <unk> <unk> upon the <unk> . in another instant he stood at 
the side of the <unk> and was <unk> after him a companion , <unk> and small like himself , with 
a <unk> face and a <unk> of very red <unk> . " it ' s all clear ," he whispered 
. " have you the <unk> and the <unk> ? great <unk> ! <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and 
i ' ll <unk> for it !" sherlock holmes had <unk> out and seized the <unk> by the <unk> . 
the other <unk> down the <unk> , and i heard the sound of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> at his 
<unk> . the light <unk> upon the <unk> of a <unk> , but holmes ' <unk> <unk> came down on 
the man ' s wrist , and the <unk> <unk> upon the <unk> floor . " it ' s no 
use , john <unk> ," said holmes <unk> . " you have no chance at all ." " so i 
see ," the other answered with the <unk> <unk> . " i fancy that my <unk> is all right , 
though i see you have got his coat - <unk> ." " there are three men waiting for him at 
the door ," said holmes . " oh , indeed ! you <unk> to have done the thing very completely 
. i must <unk> you ." " and i you ," holmes answered . " your red - headed <unk> 
was very new and <unk> ." " you ' ll see your <unk> again presently ," said <unk> . " 
he ' s <unk> at <unk> down <unk> than i am . just hold out while i <unk> the <unk> 
." " i <unk> that you will not <unk> me with your <unk> hands ," remarked our <unk> as the 
<unk> <unk> upon his <unk> . " you may not be aware that i have royal blood in my <unk> 
. have the <unk> , also , when you address me always to say ' sir ' and ' please 
<unk> " all right ," said <unk> with a <unk> and a <unk> . " well , would you please 
, sir , march <unk> , where we can get a cab to carry your <unk> to the police - 
station ?" " that is better ," said john <unk> <unk> . he made a <unk> <unk> to the three 
of us and walked quietly off in the <unk> of the <unk> . " really , mr . holmes ," 
said mr . <unk> as we followed them from the <unk> , " i do not know how the <unk> 
can thank you or <unk> you . there is no doubt that you have <unk> and <unk> in the most 
complete manner one of the most determined attempts at <unk> <unk> that have ever come within my <unk> ." " 
i have had one or two little <unk> of my own to <unk> with mr . john <unk> ," said 
holmes . " i have been at some small <unk> over this matter , which i shall <unk> the <unk> 
to <unk> , but beyond that i am <unk> <unk> by having had an <unk> which is in many <unk> 
<unk> , and by <unk> the very remarkable <unk> of the red - headed league ." " you see , 
watson ," he explained in the <unk> hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of <unk> and 
<unk> in baker street , " it was perfectly <unk> from the first that the only <unk> object of this 
rather <unk> business of the <unk> of the league , and the <unk> of the ' <unk> ,' must be 
to get this not over - <unk> <unk> out of the way for a number of hours every day . 
it was a <unk> way of <unk> it , but , really , it would be difficult to <unk> a 
better . the <unk> was no doubt suggested to <unk> ' s <unk> mind by the <unk> of his accomplice 
' s <unk> . the <unk> pounds a week was a <unk> which must draw him , and what was 
it to them , who were playing for <unk> ? they put in the <unk> , one <unk> has the 
<unk> <unk> , the other <unk> <unk> the man to <unk> for it , and together they <unk> to secure 
his <unk> every morning in the week . from the time that i heard of the <unk> having come for 
half <unk> , it was <unk> to me that he had some strong <unk> for <unk> the situation ." " 
but how could you guess what the <unk> was ?" " had there been women in the house , i 
should have suspected a <unk> <unk> <unk> . that , however , was out of the question . the man 
' s business was a small one , and there was nothing in his house which could account for such 
<unk> <unk> , and such an <unk> as they were at . it must , then , be something out 
of the house . what could it be ? i thought of the <unk> ' s <unk> for <unk> , 
and his trick of <unk> into the <unk> . the <unk> ! there was the end of this <unk> <unk> 
. then i made <unk> as to this <unk> <unk> and found that i had to deal with one of 
the <unk> and most <unk> <unk> in london . he was doing something in the <unk> -- something which took 
many hours a day for months on end . what could it be , once more ? i could think 
of nothing save that he was running a <unk> to some other <unk> . " so far i had got 
when we went to visit the scene of action . i <unk> you by <unk> upon the pavement with my 
<unk> . i was <unk> whether the <unk> stretched out in front or behind . it was not in front 
. then i rang the bell , and , as i <unk> , the <unk> answered it . we have 
had some <unk> , but we had never <unk> eyes upon each other before . i hardly looked at his 
face . his <unk> were what i wished to see . you must yourself have remarked how <unk> , <unk> 
, and <unk> they were . they spoke of those hours of <unk> . the only <unk> point was what 
they were <unk> for . i walked round the corner , saw the <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> on our 
friend ' s <unk> , and felt that i had <unk> my problem . when you drove home after the 
<unk> i called upon <unk> <unk> and upon the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , with the result that you 
have seen ." " and how could you tell that they would make their attempt to - night ?" i 
asked . " well , when they <unk> their league <unk> that was a sign that they <unk> no <unk> 
about mr . <unk> <unk> ' s <unk> -- in other <unk> , that they had completed their <unk> . 
but it was <unk> that they should use it soon , as it might be <unk> , or the <unk> 
might be <unk> . <unk> would suit them better than any other day , as it would give them two 
days for their <unk> . for all these reasons i expected them to come to - night ." " you 
<unk> it out beautifully ," i <unk> in <unk> <unk> . " it is so long a chain , and 
yet every <unk> <unk> true ." " it saved me from <unk> ," he answered , <unk> . " <unk> 
! i already <unk> it closing in upon me . my life is <unk> in one long <unk> to <unk> 
from the <unk> of <unk> . these little problems help me to do so ." " and you are a 
<unk> of the <unk> ," said i . he shrugged his shoulders . " well , perhaps , after all 
, it is of some little use ," he remarked . "' <unk> ' <unk> <unk> ' <unk> <unk> -- 
<unk> ' <unk> <unk> ' <unk> <unk> ,' as <unk> <unk> wrote to <unk> <unk> ." adventure iii . a 
case of identity " my dear fellow ," said sherlock holmes as we sat on either side of the fire 
in his lodgings at baker street , " life is <unk> <unk> than anything which the mind of man could 
<unk> . we would not <unk> to <unk> the things which are really <unk> <unk> of <unk> . if we 
could <unk> out of that window hand in hand , <unk> over this great <unk> , <unk> remove the <unk> 
, and <unk> in at the <unk> things which are <unk> on , the strange <unk> , the <unk> , 
the cross - purposes , the wonderful <unk> of <unk> , <unk> through <unk> , and <unk> to the most 
<unk> © results , it would make all <unk> with its <unk> and <unk> <unk> most <unk> and <unk> ." 
" and yet i am not <unk> of it ," i answered . " the cases which come to light 
in the papers are , as a <unk> , <unk> enough , and <unk> enough . we have in our 
police <unk> <unk> pushed to its extreme <unk> , and yet the result is , it must be <unk> , 
neither <unk> nor <unk> ." " a certain <unk> and discretion must be <unk> in <unk> a <unk> <unk> ," 
remarked holmes . " this is <unk> in the police <unk> , where more <unk> is laid , perhaps , 
upon the <unk> of the <unk> than upon the details , which to an observer <unk> the <unk> <unk> of 
the whole matter . <unk> upon it , there is nothing so <unk> as the <unk> ." i <unk> and 
<unk> my head . " i can quite understand your <unk> so ," i said . " of course , 
in your position of <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> who is absolutely <unk> , <unk> three <unk> , you 
are brought in <unk> with all that is strange and <unk> . but here <unk> i <unk> up the morning 
paper from the ground --" let us put it to a <unk> <unk> . here is the first <unk> upon 
which i come . ' a husband ' s <unk> to his wife .' there is half a <unk> of 
<unk> , but i know without <unk> it that it is all perfectly familiar to me . there is , 
of course , the other woman , the <unk> , the <unk> , the blow , the <unk> , the 
sympathetic <unk> or landlady . the <unk> of <unk> could <unk> nothing more <unk> ." " indeed , your example 
is an <unk> one for your <unk> ," said holmes , taking the paper and glancing his eye down it 
. " this is the <unk> <unk> case , and , as it <unk> , i was engaged in clearing 
up some small <unk> in <unk> with it . the husband was a <unk> , there was no other woman 
, and the conduct <unk> of was that he had drifted into the habit of <unk> up every <unk> by 
taking out his false <unk> and <unk> them at his wife , which , you will <unk> , is not 
an action likely to occur to the <unk> of the <unk> story - <unk> . take a <unk> of <unk> 
, doctor , and <unk> that i have scored over you in your example ." he <unk> out his <unk> 
of old gold , with a great <unk> in the centre of the <unk> . its <unk> was in such 
<unk> to his <unk> <unk> and simple life that i could not help <unk> upon it . " ah ," 
said he , " i <unk> that i had not seen you for some <unk> . it is a little 
<unk> from the king of bohemia in return for my <unk> in the case of the irene adler papers ." 
" and the ring ?" i asked , glancing at a remarkable <unk> which sparkled upon his <unk> . " 
it was from the reigning family of holland , though the matter in which i <unk> them was of such 
delicacy that i <unk> confide it even to you , who have been good enough to chronicle one or two 
of my little problems ." " and have you any on hand just now ?" i asked with interest . 
" some ten or twelve , but none which present any <unk> of interest . they are important , you 
understand , without being interesting . indeed , i have found that it is <unk> in <unk> matters that there 
is a field for the observation , and for the quick <unk> of cause and <unk> which gives the <unk> 
to an investigation . the <unk> crimes are <unk> to be the <unk> , for the <unk> the crime the 
more <unk> , as a <unk> , is the <unk> . in these cases , save for one rather <unk> 
matter which has been <unk> to me from <unk> , there is nothing which <unk> any features of interest . 
it is <unk> , however , that i may have something better before very many minutes are over , for 
this is one of my <unk> , or i am much mistaken ." he had risen from his chair and 
was standing between the <unk> blinds <unk> down into the dull neutral - tinted london street . looking over his 
shoulder , i saw that on the pavement <unk> there stood a large woman with a heavy fur <unk> round 
her neck , and a large <unk> red <unk> in a broad - brimmed hat which was <unk> in a 
<unk> <unk> of <unk> fashion over her ear . from under this great <unk> she <unk> up in a nervous 
, <unk> fashion at our windows , while her <unk> <unk> <unk> and forward , and her <unk> <unk> with 
her <unk> <unk> . suddenly , with a <unk> , as of the <unk> who <unk> the <unk> , she 
hurried across the road , and we heard the sharp <unk> of the bell . " i have seen those 
<unk> before ," said holmes , throwing his cigarette into the fire . " <unk> upon the pavement always means 
an <unk> <unk> <unk> . she would like <unk> , but is not sure that the matter is not too 
delicate for <unk> . and yet even here we may <unk> . when a woman has been seriously wronged by 
a man she no <unk> <unk> , and the usual <unk> is a broken bell wire . here we may 
take it that there is a love matter , but that the <unk> is not so much <unk> as <unk> 
, or <unk> . but here she comes in person to resolve our doubts ." as he spoke there was 
a tap at the door , and the boy in <unk> entered to <unk> miss mary <unk> , while the 
lady herself <unk> behind his small black figure like a <unk> - <unk> <unk> - man behind a <unk> <unk> 
<unk> . sherlock holmes <unk> her with the easy <unk> for which he was remarkable , and , having <unk> 
the door and <unk> her into an armchair , he looked her over in the <unk> and yet <unk> fashion 
which was peculiar to him . " do you not find ," he said , " that with your <unk> 
<unk> it is a little <unk> to do so much <unk> ?" " i did at first ," she answered 
, " but now i know where the letters are without looking ." then , suddenly <unk> the <unk> <unk> 
of his <unk> , she gave a <unk> start and looked up , with fear and <unk> upon her broad 
, good - <unk> face . " you ' ve heard about me , mr . holmes ," she cried 
, " else how could you know all that ?" " never mind ," said holmes , laughing ; " 
it is my business to know things . perhaps i have trained myself to see what others <unk> . if 
not , why should you come to consult me ?" " i came to you , sir , because i 
heard of you from mrs . <unk> , whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had 
given him up for dead . oh , mr . holmes , i wish you would do as much for 
me . i ' <unk> not rich , but still i have a hundred a year in my own right 
, besides the little that i make by the machine , and i would give it all to know what 
has <unk> of mr . <unk> <unk> ." " why did you come away to consult me in such a 
hurry ?" asked sherlock holmes , with his <unk> - <unk> together and his eyes to the <unk> . again 
a startled look came over the <unk> <unk> face of miss mary <unk> . " yes , i did <unk> 
out of the house ," she said , " for it made me <unk> to see the easy way in 
which mr . <unk> -- that is , my <unk> -- took it all . he would not go to 
the police , and he would not go to you , and so at last , as he would do 
nothing and <unk> on <unk> that there was no <unk> done , it made me mad , and i just 
on with my things and came right away to you ." " your <unk> ," said holmes , " your 
<unk> , surely , since the name is different ." " yes , my <unk> . i call him <unk> 
, though it <unk> funny , too , for he is only five years and two months <unk> than myself 
." " and your <unk> is <unk> ?" " oh , yes , <unk> is <unk> and well . i 
<unk> ' t best <unk> , mr . holmes , when she married again so soon after <unk> ' s 
death , and a man who was nearly <unk> years <unk> than herself . <unk> was a plumber in the 
<unk> <unk> road , and he left a <unk> business behind him , which <unk> carried on with mr . 
<unk> , the <unk> ; but when mr . <unk> came he made her sell the business , for he 
was very <unk> , being a <unk> in <unk> . they got <unk> pounds for the <unk> and interest , 
which <unk> ' t near as much as <unk> could have got if he had been <unk> ." i had 
expected to see sherlock holmes <unk> under this <unk> and <unk> <unk> , but , on the contrary , he 
had listened with the <unk> <unk> of attention . " your own little <unk> ," he asked , " does 
it come out of the business ?" " oh , no , sir . it is quite <unk> and was 
left me by my <unk> <unk> in <unk> . it is in new <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
<unk> <unk> <unk> . two <unk> five hundred pounds was the <unk> , but i can only <unk> the interest 
." " you interest me <unk> ," said holmes . " and since you draw so large a <unk> as 
a hundred a year , with what you <unk> into the <unk> , you no doubt <unk> a little and 
<unk> yourself in every way . i believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an <unk> 
of about <unk> pounds ." " i could do with much less than that , mr . holmes , but 
you understand that as long as i <unk> at home i don ' t wish to be a <unk> to 
them , and so they have the use of the money just while i am <unk> with them . of 
course , that is only just for the time . mr . <unk> <unk> my interest every quarter and <unk> 
it over to <unk> , and i find that i can do pretty well with what i <unk> at <unk> 
. it <unk> me twopence a sheet , and i can often do from <unk> to twenty <unk> in a 
day ." " you have made your position very clear to me ," said holmes . " this is my 
friend , dr . watson , before whom you can speak as freely as before myself . kindly tell us 
now all about your <unk> with mr . <unk> <unk> ." a <unk> <unk> over miss <unk> ' s face 
, and she <unk> <unk> at the <unk> of her <unk> . " i <unk> him first at the <unk> 
' <unk> ," she said . " they <unk> to send <unk> <unk> when he was <unk> , and then 
afterwards they remembered us , and sent them to <unk> . mr . <unk> did not wish us to go 
. he never did wish us to go anywhere . he would get quite mad if i wanted so much 
as to join a <unk> - <unk> <unk> . but this time i was <unk> on <unk> , and i 
would go ; for what right had he to <unk> ? he said the <unk> were not <unk> for us 
to know , when all <unk> ' s <unk> were to be there . and he said that i had 
nothing <unk> to wear , when i had my <unk> <unk> that i had never so much as taken out 
of the <unk> . at last , when nothing else would do , he went off to <unk> upon the 
business of the <unk> , but we went , <unk> and i , with mr . <unk> , who <unk> 
to be our <unk> , and it was there i <unk> mr . <unk> <unk> ." " i suppose ," 
said holmes , " that when mr . <unk> came back from <unk> he was very <unk> at your having 
gone to the <unk> ." " oh , well , he was very good about it . he laughed , 
i remember , and shrugged his shoulders , and said there was no use <unk> anything to a woman , 
for she would have her way ." " i see . then at the <unk> ' <unk> you <unk> , 
as i understand , a gentleman called mr . <unk> <unk> ." " yes , sir . i <unk> him 
that night , and he called next day to <unk> if we had got home all safe , and after 
that we <unk> him -- that is to say , mr . holmes , i <unk> him twice for walks 
, but after that <unk> came back again , and mr . <unk> <unk> could not come to the house 
any more ." " no ?" " well , you know <unk> <unk> ' t like anything of the sort 
. he <unk> ' t have any <unk> if he could help it , and he <unk> to say that 
a woman should be <unk> in her own family <unk> . but then , as i <unk> to say to 
<unk> , a woman <unk> her own <unk> to begin with , and i had not got mine yet ." 
" but how about mr . <unk> <unk> ? did he make no attempt to see you ?" " well 
, <unk> was <unk> off to <unk> again in a week , and <unk> wrote and said that it would 
be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone . we could <unk> in the <unk> 
, and he <unk> to <unk> every day . i took the letters in in the morning , so there 
was no need for <unk> to know ." " were you engaged to the gentleman at this time ?" " 
oh , yes , mr . holmes . we were engaged after the first walk that we took . <unk> 
-- mr . <unk> -- was a <unk> in an <unk> in <unk> street -- and --" " what <unk> 
?" " that ' s the <unk> of it , mr . holmes , i don ' t know ." 
" where did he <unk> , then ?" " he slept on the <unk> ." " and you don ' 
t know his address ?" " no -- except that it was <unk> street ." " where did you address 
your letters , then ?" " to the <unk> street post <unk> , to be left till called for . 
he said that if they were sent to the <unk> he would be <unk> by all the other <unk> about 
having letters from a lady , so i <unk> to <unk> them , like he did his , but he 
<unk> ' t have that , for he said that when i wrote them they seemed to come from me 
, but when they were <unk> he always felt that the machine had come between us . that will just 
show you how <unk> he was of me , mr . holmes , and the little things that he would 
think of ." " it was most suggestive ," said holmes . " it has long been an <unk> of 
mine that the little things are <unk> the most important . can you remember any other little things about mr 
. <unk> <unk> ?" " he was a very <unk> man , mr . holmes . he would rather walk 
with me in the evening than in the <unk> , for he said that he <unk> to be <unk> . 
very <unk> and <unk> he was . even his voice was <unk> . he ' <unk> had the <unk> and 
<unk> <unk> when he was young , he told me , and it had left him with a <unk> <unk> 
, and a <unk> , <unk> fashion of <unk> . he was always well dressed , very neat and <unk> 
, but his eyes were <unk> , just as mine are , and he wore tinted <unk> against the <unk> 
." " well , and what <unk> when mr . <unk> , your <unk> , returned to <unk> ?" " 
mr . <unk> <unk> came to the house again and <unk> that we should marry before <unk> came back . 
he was in dreadful <unk> and made me <unk> , with my hands on the <unk> , that whatever <unk> 
i would always be true to him . <unk> said he was quite right to make me <unk> , and 
that it was a sign of his <unk> . <unk> was all in his <unk> from the first and was 
even <unk> of him than i was . then , when they <unk> of <unk> within the week , i 
began to <unk> about <unk> ; but they both said never to mind about <unk> , but just to tell 
him afterwards , and <unk> said she would make it all right with him . i <unk> ' t quite 
like that , mr . holmes . it seemed funny that i should <unk> his leave , as he was 
only a few years <unk> than me ; but i <unk> ' t want to do anything on the <unk> 
, so i wrote to <unk> at <unk> , where the company has its <unk> <unk> , but the letter 
came back to me on the very morning of the <unk> ." " it <unk> him , then ?" " 
yes , sir ; for he had started to england just before it arrived ." " ha ! that was 
<unk> . your <unk> was arranged , then , for the <unk> . was it to be in church ?" 
" yes , sir , but very quietly . it was to be at st . <unk> ' s , 
near king ' s cross , and we were to have <unk> afterwards at the st . <unk> <unk> . 
<unk> came for us in a hansom , but as there were two of us he put us both into 
it and stepped himself into a four - <unk> , which <unk> to be the only other cab in the 
street . we got to the church first , and when the four - <unk> drove up we waited for 
him to step out , but he never did , and when the cabman got down from the box and 
looked there was no one there ! the cabman said that he could not imagine what had <unk> of him 
, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes . that was last <unk> , mr . 
holmes , and i have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of 
him ." " it seems to me that you have been very <unk> <unk> ," said holmes . " oh 
, no , sir ! he was too good and kind to leave me so . why , all the 
morning he was <unk> to me that , whatever <unk> , i was to be true ; and that even 
if something quite <unk> <unk> to <unk> us , i was always to remember that i was <unk> to him 
, and that he would <unk> his <unk> sooner or later . it seemed strange <unk> for a <unk> - 
morning , but what has <unk> since gives a <unk> to it ." " most certainly it does . your 
own <unk> is , then , that some <unk> <unk> has <unk> to him ?" " yes , sir . 
i believe that he <unk> some <unk> , or else he would not have <unk> so . and then i 
think that what he <unk> <unk> ." " but you have no <unk> as to what it could have been 
?" " none ." " one more question . how did your <unk> take the matter ?" " she was 
<unk> , and said that i was never to speak of the matter again ." " and your <unk> ? 
did you tell him ?" " yes ; and he seemed to think , with me , that something had 
<unk> , and that i should hear of <unk> again . as he said , what interest could anyone have 
in <unk> me to the <unk> of the church , and then <unk> me ? now , if he had 
<unk> my money , or if he had married me and got my money <unk> on him , there might 
be some reason , but <unk> was very <unk> about money and never would look at a <unk> of mine 
. and yet , what could have <unk> ? and why could he not <unk> ? oh , it drives 
me half - mad to think of it , and i can ' t <unk> a <unk> at night ." 
she pulled a little <unk> out of her <unk> and began to <unk> <unk> into it . " i shall 
glance into the case for you ," said holmes , <unk> , " and i have no doubt that we 
shall reach some <unk> result . let the weight of the matter rest upon me now , and do not 
let your mind <unk> upon it <unk> . above all , <unk> to let mr . <unk> <unk> <unk> from 
your memory , as he has done from your life ." " then you don ' t think i ' 
ll see him again ?" " i fear not ." " then what has <unk> to him ?" " you 
will leave that question in my hands . i should like an <unk> description of him and any letters of 
his which you can spare ." " i <unk> for him in last <unk> ' s chronicle ," said she 
. " here is the <unk> and here are four letters from him ." " thank you . and your 
address ?" " no . <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ." " mr . <unk> ' s address you never 
had , i understand . where is your <unk> ' s <unk> of business ?" " he <unk> for <unk> 
& <unk> , the great <unk> <unk> of <unk> street ." " thank you . you have made your <unk> 
very <unk> . you will leave the papers here , and remember the <unk> which i have given you . 
let the whole <unk> be a <unk> book , and do not <unk> it to <unk> your life ." " 
you are very kind , mr . holmes , but i <unk> do that . i shall be true to 
<unk> . he shall find me <unk> when he comes back ." for all the preposterous hat and the <unk> 
face , there was something noble in the simple <unk> of our visitor which compelled our <unk> . she laid 
her little <unk> of papers upon the table and went her way , with a promise to come again <unk> 
she might be <unk> . sherlock holmes sat <unk> for a few minutes with his <unk> still <unk> together , 
his legs stretched out in front of him , and his gaze <unk> <unk> to the <unk> . then he 
took down from the <unk> the old and <unk> <unk> <unk> , which was to him as a <unk> , 
and , having lit it , he <unk> back in his chair , with the thick blue cloud - <unk> 
<unk> up from him , and a look of <unk> <unk> in his face . " quite an interesting study 
, that <unk> ," he observed . " i found her more interesting than her little problem , which , 
by the way , is rather a <unk> one . you will find parallel cases , if you consult my 
index , in <unk> in ' <unk> , and there was something of the sort at the <unk> last year 
. old as is the <unk> , however , there were one or two details which were new to me 
. but the <unk> herself was most <unk> ." " you appeared to read a good deal upon her which 
was quite <unk> to me ," i remarked . " not <unk> but <unk> , watson . you did not 
know where to look , and so you <unk> all that was important . i can never bring you to 
<unk> the importance of sleeves , the <unk> of thumb - <unk> , or the great <unk> that may <unk> 
from a boot - <unk> . now , what did you <unk> from that woman ' s appearance ? <unk> 
it ." " well , she had a <unk> - coloured , broad - brimmed <unk> hat , with a 
<unk> of a <unk> red . her <unk> was black , with black <unk> <unk> upon it , and a 
<unk> of little black <unk> <unk> . her dress was brown , rather <unk> than coffee <unk> , with a 
little <unk> <unk> at the neck and sleeves . her <unk> were <unk> and were <unk> through at the right 
forefinger . her boots i <unk> ' t observe . she had small round , hanging gold <unk> , and 
a general air of being <unk> well - to - do in a <unk> , comfortable , easy - <unk> 
way ." sherlock holmes clapped his hands <unk> together and chuckled . "' <unk> my word , watson , you 
are coming <unk> <unk> . you have really done very well indeed . it is true that you have <unk> 
<unk> of importance , but you have <unk> upon the <unk> , and you have a quick eye for <unk> 
. never trust to general <unk> , my boy , but <unk> yourself upon details . my first glance is 
always at a woman ' s <unk> . in a man it is perhaps better first to take the <unk> 
of the <unk> . as you observe , this woman had <unk> upon her sleeves , which is a most 
<unk> <unk> for showing <unk> . the double line a little above the wrist , where the <unk> <unk> against 
the table , was beautifully <unk> . the <unk> - machine , of the hand <unk> , <unk> a <unk> 
mark , but only on the left arm , and on the side of it <unk> from the thumb , 
instead of being right across the <unk> part , as this was . i then glanced at her face , 
and , observing the <unk> of a <unk> - <unk> at either side of her <unk> , i <unk> a 
<unk> upon <unk> <unk> and <unk> , which seemed to surprise her ." " it <unk> me ." " but 
, surely , it was <unk> . i was then much <unk> and interested on glancing down to observe that 
, though the boots which she was wearing were not <unk> each other , they were really <unk> <unk> ; 
the one having a <unk> <unk> <unk> - cap , and the other a <unk> one . one was buttoned 
only in the two lower <unk> out of five , and the other at the first , <unk> , and 
<unk> . now , when you see that a young lady , <unk> <unk> dressed , has come away from 
home with <unk> boots , half - buttoned , it is no great deduction to say that she came away 
in a hurry ." " and what else ?" i asked , <unk> interested , as i always was , 
by my friend ' s incisive reasoning . " i <unk> , in passing , that she had written a 
note before <unk> home but after being <unk> dressed . you observed that her right <unk> was <unk> at the 
forefinger , but you did not apparently see that both <unk> and <unk> were <unk> with <unk> <unk> . she 
had written in a hurry and <unk> her <unk> too deep . it must have been this morning , or 
the mark would not remain clear upon the <unk> . all this is <unk> , though rather <unk> , but 
i must go back to business , watson . would you mind <unk> me the <unk> description of mr . 
<unk> <unk> ?" i <unk> the little <unk> <unk> to the light . " <unk> ," it said , " 
on the morning of the <unk> , a gentleman named <unk> <unk> . about five <unk> . seven in . 
in height ; strongly built , <unk> <unk> , black <unk> , a little <unk> in the centre , <unk> 
, black side - <unk> and <unk> ; tinted <unk> , <unk> <unk> of <unk> . was dressed , when 
last seen , in black <unk> - coat faced with silk , black <unk> , gold <unk> chain , and 
<unk> <unk> tweed trousers , with brown <unk> over <unk> - <unk> boots . known to have been employed in 
an <unk> in <unk> street . <unk> <unk> --" " that will do ," said holmes . " as to 
the letters ," he continued , glancing over them , " they are very <unk> . absolutely no <unk> in 
them to mr . <unk> , save that he <unk> <unk> once . there is one remarkable point , however 
, which will no doubt <unk> you ." " they are <unk> ," i remarked . " not only that 
, but the signature is <unk> . look at the neat little ' <unk> <unk> ' at the <unk> . 
there is a date , you see , but no <unk> except <unk> street , which is rather vague . 
the point about the signature is very suggestive -- in <unk> , we may call it <unk> ." " of 
what ?" " my dear fellow , is it <unk> you do not see how strongly it <unk> upon the 
case ?" " i <unk> say that i do <unk> it were that he wished to be able to <unk> 
his signature if an action for <unk> of promise were <unk> ." " no , that was not the point 
. however , i shall <unk> two letters , which should <unk> the matter . one is to a <unk> 
in the <unk> , the other is to the young lady ' s <unk> , mr . <unk> , <unk> 
him whether he could meet us here at six o ' clock <unk> evening . it is just as well 
that we should do business with the male <unk> . and now , doctor , we can do nothing until 
the <unk> to those letters come , so we may put our little problem upon the <unk> for the <unk> 
." i had had so many reasons to believe in my friend ' s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary 
energy in action that i felt that he must have some <unk> <unk> for the <unk> and easy <unk> with 
which he <unk> the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom . once only had i known 
him to fail , in the case of the king of bohemia and of the irene adler photograph ; but 
when i looked back to the <unk> business of the sign of four , and the extraordinary circumstances <unk> with 
the study in scarlet , i felt that it would be a strange <unk> indeed which he could not <unk> 
. i left him then , still <unk> at his black <unk> <unk> , with the <unk> that when i 
came again on the next evening i would find that he <unk> in his hands all the clues which would 
lead up to the identity of the <unk> bridegroom of miss mary <unk> . a <unk> case of great <unk> 
was <unk> my own attention at the time , and the whole of next day i was busy at the 
<unk> of the <unk> . it was not until close upon six o ' clock that i found myself <unk> 
and was able to <unk> into a hansom and drive to baker street , half <unk> that i might be 
too late to <unk> at the <unk> © <unk> of the little mystery . i found sherlock holmes alone , 
however , half <unk> , with his long , <unk> form curled up in the <unk> of his armchair . 
a formidable <unk> of <unk> and <unk> - <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , told 
me that he had <unk> his day in the <unk> work which was so dear to him . " well 
, have you <unk> it ?" i asked as i entered . " yes . it was the <unk> of 
<unk> ." " no , no , the mystery !" i cried . " oh , that ! i thought 
of the <unk> that i have been <unk> upon . there was never any mystery in the matter , though 
, as i said yesterday , some of the details are of interest . the only <unk> is that there 
is no law , i fear , that can <unk> the <unk> ." " who was he , then , 
and what was his object in <unk> miss <unk> ?" the question was hardly out of my mouth , and 
holmes had not yet opened his <unk> to <unk> , when we heard a heavy <unk> in the passage and 
a tap at the door . " this is the girl ' s <unk> , mr . <unk> <unk> ," 
said holmes . " he has written to me to say that he would be here at six . come 
in !" the man who entered was a <unk> , <unk> - <unk> fellow , some thirty years of <unk> 
, <unk> - <unk> , and <unk> - <unk> , with a <unk> , <unk> manner , and a pair 
of <unk> sharp and <unk> <unk> eyes . he shot a questioning glance at each of us , placed his 
<unk> top - hat upon the <unk> , and with a <unk> <unk> <unk> down into the <unk> chair . 
" good - evening , mr . <unk> <unk> ," said holmes . " i think that this <unk> letter 
is from you , in which you made an <unk> with me for six o ' clock ?" " yes 
, sir . i am <unk> that i am a little late , but i am not quite my own 
master , you know . i am sorry that miss <unk> has <unk> you about this little matter , for 
i think it is far better not to <unk> <unk> of the sort in <unk> . it was quite against 
my wishes that she came , but she is a very <unk> , <unk> girl , as you may have 
<unk> , and she is not easily <unk> when she has made up her mind on a point . of 
course , i did not mind you so much , as you are not <unk> with the official police , 
but it is not <unk> to have a family <unk> like this <unk> <unk> . besides , it is a 
<unk> <unk> , for how could you <unk> find this <unk> <unk> ?" " on the contrary ," said holmes 
quietly ; " i have every reason to believe that i will <unk> in <unk> mr . <unk> <unk> ." 
mr . <unk> gave a <unk> start and dropped his <unk> . " i am delighted to hear it ," 
he said . " it is a <unk> thing ," remarked holmes , " that a <unk> has really quite 
as much <unk> as a man ' s <unk> . <unk> they are quite new , no two of them 
<unk> exactly <unk> . some letters get more <unk> than others , and some wear only on one side . 
now , you <unk> in this note of yours , mr . <unk> , that in every case there is 
some little <unk> over of the ' e ,' and a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the ' <unk> 
.' there are <unk> other <unk> , but those are the more <unk> ." " we do all our <unk> 
with this machine at the <unk> , and no doubt it is a little <unk> ," our visitor answered , 
glancing <unk> at holmes with his <unk> little eyes . " and now i will show you what is really 
a very interesting study , mr . <unk> ," holmes continued . " i think of writing another little monograph 
some of these days on the <unk> and its relation to crime . it is a subject to which i 
have <unk> some little attention . i have here four letters which <unk> to come from the <unk> man . 
they are all <unk> . in each case , not only are the ' e ' s ' <unk> and 
the ' <unk> ' s ' <unk> , but you will observe , if you care to use my <unk> 
<unk> , that the <unk> other <unk> to which i have <unk> are there as well ." mr . <unk> 
sprang out of his chair and <unk> up his hat . " i <unk> <unk> time over this sort of 
<unk> <unk> , mr . holmes ," he said . " if you can catch the man , catch him 
, and let me know when you have done it ." " certainly ," said holmes , <unk> over and 
<unk> the key in the door . " i let you know , then , that i have caught him 
!" " what ! where ?" shouted mr . <unk> , <unk> white to his <unk> and glancing about him 
like a <unk> in a <unk> . " oh , it won ' t do -- really it won ' 
t ," said holmes <unk> . " there is no <unk> getting out of it , mr . <unk> . 
it is quite too <unk> , and it was a very bad <unk> when you said that it was <unk> 
for me to <unk> so simple a question . that ' s right ! sit down and let us <unk> 
it over ." our visitor <unk> into a chair , with a <unk> face and a <unk> of <unk> on 
his <unk> . " it -- it ' s not <unk> ," he <unk> . " i am very much 
<unk> that it is not . but between ourselves , <unk> , it was as <unk> and <unk> and <unk> 
a trick in a <unk> way as ever came before me . now , let me just run over the 
course of <unk> , and you will <unk> me if i go <unk> ." the man sat <unk> up in 
his chair , with his head sunk upon his <unk> , like one who is <unk> <unk> . holmes <unk> 
his feet up on the corner of the <unk> and , <unk> back with his hands in his pockets , 
began talking , rather to himself , as it seemed , than to us . " the man married a 
woman very much <unk> than himself for her money ," said he , " and he <unk> the use of 
the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them . it was a <unk> <unk> , for 
people in their position , and the <unk> of it would have made a serious <unk> . it was <unk> 
an <unk> to preserve it . the daughter was of a good , amiable <unk> , but <unk> and <unk> 
- <unk> in her <unk> , so that it was <unk> that with her <unk> <unk> advantages , and her 
little <unk> , she would not be <unk> to remain single long . now her marriage would mean , of 
course , the <unk> of a hundred a year , so what does her <unk> do to <unk> it ? 
he <unk> the <unk> course of keeping her at home and <unk> her to <unk> the company of people of 
her own <unk> . but soon he found that that would not <unk> <unk> . she became <unk> , <unk> 
upon her <unk> , and finally <unk> her <unk> intention of <unk> to a certain <unk> . what does her 
<unk> <unk> do then ? he <unk> an <unk> more <unk> to his head than to his heart . with 
the <unk> and <unk> of his wife he <unk> himself , <unk> those keen eyes with tinted <unk> , <unk> 
the face with a <unk> and a pair of <unk> <unk> , sunk that clear voice into an <unk> <unk> 
, and <unk> secure on account of the girl ' s <unk> <unk> , he appears as mr . <unk> 
<unk> , and <unk> off other <unk> by making love himself ." " it was only a <unk> at first 
," <unk> our visitor . " we never thought that she would have been so carried away ." " very 
likely not . however that may be , the young lady was very <unk> carried away , and , having 
quite made up her mind that her <unk> was in <unk> , the suspicion of treachery never for an instant 
entered her mind . she was <unk> by the gentleman ' s <unk> , and the <unk> was increased by 
the <unk> <unk> <unk> of her <unk> . then mr . <unk> began to call , for it was <unk> 
that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a <unk> <unk> were to be produced 
. there were <unk> , and an <unk> , which would finally secure the girl ' s <unk> from <unk> 
towards anyone else . but the <unk> could not be <unk> up <unk> . these <unk> <unk> to <unk> were 
rather <unk> . the thing to do was <unk> to bring the business to an end in such a <unk> 
manner that it would leave a <unk> impression upon the young lady ' s mind and <unk> her from looking 
upon any other <unk> for some time to come . hence those <unk> of <unk> <unk> upon a <unk> , 
and hence also the <unk> to a possibility of something <unk> on the very morning of the <unk> . <unk> 
<unk> wished miss <unk> to be so bound to <unk> <unk> , and so uncertain as to his <unk> , 
that for ten years to come , at any <unk> , she would not listen to another man . as 
far as the church door he brought her , and then , as he could go no <unk> , he 
<unk> vanished away by the old trick of <unk> in at one door of a four - <unk> and out 
at the other . i think that was the chain of <unk> , mr . <unk> !" our visitor had 
recovered something of his <unk> while holmes had been talking , and he rose from his chair now with a 
cold sneer upon his <unk> face . " it may be so , or it may not , mr . 
holmes ," said he , " but if you are so very sharp you <unk> to be sharp enough to 
know that it is you who are breaking the law now , and not me . i have done nothing 
<unk> from the first , but as long as you keep that door <unk> you lay yourself open to an 
action for <unk> and <unk> <unk> ." " the law <unk> , as you say , <unk> you ," said 
holmes , <unk> and throwing open the door , " yet there never was a man who <unk> <unk> more 
. if the young lady has a <unk> or a friend , he <unk> to lay a <unk> across your 
shoulders . by <unk> !" he continued , <unk> up at the <unk> of the <unk> sneer upon the man 
' s face , " it is not part of my <unk> to my client , but here ' s 
a <unk> <unk> <unk> , and i think i shall just <unk> myself to --" he took two <unk> steps 
to the <unk> , but before he could grasp it there was a <unk> <unk> of steps upon the stairs 
, the heavy hall door <unk> , and from the window we could see mr . <unk> <unk> running at 
the top of his <unk> down the road . " there ' s a cold - <unk> <unk> !" said 
holmes , laughing , as he threw himself down into his chair once more . " that fellow will rise 
from crime to crime until he does something very bad , and <unk> on a <unk> . the case has 
, in some <unk> , been not entirely <unk> of interest ." " i <unk> now entirely see all the 
steps of your reasoning ," i remarked . " well , of course it was <unk> from the first that 
this mr . <unk> <unk> must have some strong object for his <unk> conduct , and it was equally clear 
that the only man who really <unk> by the <unk> , as far as we could see , was the 
<unk> . then the <unk> that the two men were never together , but that the one always appeared when 
the other was away , was suggestive . so were the tinted <unk> and the <unk> voice , which both 
<unk> at a <unk> , as did the <unk> <unk> . my <unk> were all <unk> by his peculiar action 
in <unk> his signature , which , of course , <unk> that his <unk> was so familiar to her that 
she would <unk> even the <unk> <unk> of it . you see all these <unk> facts , together with many 
<unk> <unk> , all <unk> in the same direction ." " and how did you <unk> them ?" " having 
once <unk> my man , it was easy to get <unk> . i knew the <unk> for which this man 
<unk> . having taken the <unk> description . i <unk> <unk> from it which could be the result of a 
<unk> -- the <unk> , the <unk> , the voice , and i sent it to the <unk> , with 
a <unk> that they would <unk> me whether it answered to the description of any of their <unk> . i 
had already <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> , and i wrote to the man himself at his business address 
<unk> him if he would come here . as i expected , his <unk> was <unk> and <unk> the same 
<unk> but <unk> <unk> . the same post brought me a letter from <unk> & <unk> , of <unk> street 
, to say that the description <unk> in every <unk> with that of their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . <unk> 
<unk> !" " and miss <unk> ?" " if i tell her she will not believe me . you may 
remember the old <unk> <unk> , ' there is <unk> for him who <unk> the <unk> <unk> , and <unk> 
also for <unk> <unk> a <unk> from a woman .' there is as much <unk> in <unk> as in <unk> 
, and as much <unk> of the world ." adventure iv . the boscombe valley mystery we were <unk> at 
<unk> one morning , my wife and i , when the maid brought in a <unk> . it was from 
sherlock holmes and ran in this way : " have you a <unk> of days to spare ? have just 
been <unk> for from the <unk> of england in <unk> with boscombe valley tragedy . shall be glad if you 
will come with me . air and <unk> perfect . leave <unk> by the <unk> : 15 ." " what 
do you say , dear ?" said my wife , looking across at me . " will you go ?" 
" i really don ' t know what to say . i have a <unk> long <unk> at present ." 
" oh , <unk> would do your work for you . you have been looking a little <unk> lately . 
i think that the change would do you good , and you are always so interested in mr . sherlock 
holmes ' cases ." " i should be <unk> if i were not , <unk> what i <unk> through one 
of them ," i answered . " but if i am to go , i must <unk> at once , 
for i have only half an hour ." my <unk> of <unk> life in <unk> had at least had the 
<unk> of making me a prompt and <unk> <unk> . my <unk> were few and simple , so that in 
less than the time <unk> i was in a cab with my <unk> , <unk> away to <unk> station . 
sherlock holmes was pacing up and down the <unk> , his tall , <unk> figure made even <unk> and <unk> 
by his long <unk> <unk> - cloak and close - <unk> <unk> cap . " it is really very good 
of you to come , watson ," said he . " it <unk> a <unk> <unk> to me , having 
someone with me on whom i can thoroughly rely . <unk> <unk> is always either <unk> or else <unk> . 
if you will keep the two corner <unk> i shall get the <unk> ." we had the carriage to ourselves 
save for an immense <unk> of papers which holmes had brought with him . among these he <unk> and read 
, with <unk> of note - taking and of <unk> , until we were past <unk> . then he suddenly 
rolled them all into a gigantic <unk> and tossed them up <unk> the <unk> . " have you heard anything 
of the case ?" he asked . " not a word . i have not seen a paper for some 
days ." " the london press has not had very <unk> <unk> . i have just been looking through all 
the recent papers in order to master the <unk> . it seems , from what i <unk> , to be 
one of those simple cases which are so <unk> difficult ." " that <unk> a little <unk> ." " but 
it is <unk> true . <unk> is almost <unk> a <unk> . the more <unk> and <unk> a crime is 
, the more difficult it is to bring it home . in this case , however , they have <unk> 
a very serious case against the <unk> of the <unk> man ." " it is a murder , then ?" 
" well , it is <unk> to be so . i shall take nothing for <unk> until i have the 
<unk> of looking <unk> into it . i will explain the state of things to you , as far as 
i have been able to understand it , in a very few <unk> . " boscombe valley is a country 
<unk> not very far from <unk> , in <unk> . the <unk> <unk> <unk> in that part is a mr 
. john turner , who made his money in <unk> and returned some years ago to the old country . 
one of the <unk> which he <unk> , that of <unk> , was let to mr . <unk> <unk> , 
who was also an <unk> - <unk> . the men had known each other in the <unk> , so that 
it was not <unk> that when they came to <unk> down they should do so as near each other as 
<unk> . turner was apparently the <unk> man , so <unk> became his <unk> but still remained , it seems 
, upon terms of perfect <unk> , as they were frequently together . <unk> had one <unk> , a <unk> 
of <unk> , and turner had an only daughter of the same <unk> , but neither of them had <unk> 
living . they <unk> to have <unk> the society of the <unk> english families and to have led retired lives 
, though both the <unk> were <unk> of <unk> and were frequently seen at the <unk> - <unk> of the 
neighbourhood . <unk> <unk> two <unk> -- a man and a girl . turner had a <unk> <unk> , some 
half - dozen at the least . that is as much as i have been able to <unk> about the 
families . now for the facts . " on <unk> <unk> , that is , on monday last , <unk> 
left his house at <unk> about three in the afternoon and walked down to the boscombe <unk> , which is 
a small <unk> <unk> by the <unk> out of the <unk> which runs down the boscombe valley . he had 
been out with his <unk> - man in the morning at <unk> , and he had told the man that 
he must hurry , as he had an <unk> of importance to keep at three . from that <unk> he 
never came back <unk> . " from <unk> <unk> - house to the boscombe <unk> is a quarter of a 
<unk> , and two people saw him as he passed over this ground . one was an old woman , 
whose name is not <unk> , and the other was <unk> <unk> , a <unk> - <unk> in the <unk> 
of mr . turner . both these <unk> <unk> that mr . <unk> was walking alone . the <unk> - 
<unk> <unk> that within a few minutes of his <unk> mr . <unk> pass he had seen his <unk> , 
mr . <unk> <unk> , <unk> the same way with a <unk> under his arm . to the best of 
his <unk> , the <unk> was <unk> in <unk> at the time , and the <unk> was following him . 
he thought no more of the matter until he heard in the evening of the tragedy that had <unk> . 
" the two <unk> were seen after the time when <unk> <unk> , the <unk> - <unk> , lost <unk> 
of them . the boscombe <unk> is <unk> <unk> round , with just a <unk> of <unk> and of <unk> 
round the <unk> . a girl of <unk> , <unk> <unk> , who is the daughter of the lodge - 
<unk> of the boscombe valley <unk> , was in one of the <unk> <unk> <unk> . she <unk> that while 
she was there she saw , at the <unk> of the wood and close by the <unk> , mr . 
<unk> and his <unk> , and that they appeared to be having a <unk> quarrel . she heard mr . 
<unk> the <unk> <unk> very strong language to his <unk> , and she saw the latter raise up his hand 
as if to <unk> his <unk> . she was so <unk> by their <unk> that she ran away and told 
her <unk> when she reached home that she had left the two <unk> <unk> near boscombe <unk> , and that 
she was <unk> that they were <unk> to <unk> . she had hardly said the <unk> when young mr . 
<unk> came running up to the lodge to say that he had found his <unk> dead in the wood , 
and to <unk> for the help of the lodge - <unk> . he was much <unk> , without either his 
<unk> or his hat , and his right hand and <unk> were observed to be <unk> with fresh blood . 
on following him they found the dead <unk> stretched out upon the <unk> beside the <unk> . the head had 
been <unk> in by repeated <unk> of some heavy and <unk> weapon . the <unk> were such as might very 
well have been <unk> by the <unk> - end of his <unk> ' s <unk> , which was found lying 
on the <unk> within a few <unk> of the <unk> . under these circumstances the young man was <unk> <unk> 
, and a <unk> of ' <unk> murder ' having been returned at the <unk> on <unk> , he was 
on <unk> brought before the <unk> at <unk> , who have <unk> the case to the next <unk> . those 
are the <unk> facts of the case as they came out before the <unk> and the police - <unk> ." 
" i could hardly imagine a more <unk> case ," i remarked . " if ever <unk> <unk> <unk> to 
a <unk> it does so here ." " <unk> <unk> is a very <unk> thing ," answered holmes <unk> . 
" it may <unk> to point very straight to one thing , but if you <unk> your own point of 
view a little , you may find it <unk> in an equally <unk> manner to something entirely different . it 
must be <unk> , however , that the case <unk> <unk> <unk> against the young man , and it is 
very <unk> that he is indeed the <unk> . there are several people in the neighbourhood , however , and 
among them miss turner , the daughter of the <unk> <unk> , who believe in his <unk> , and who 
have <unk> <unk> , whom you may <unk> in <unk> with the study in scarlet , to work out the 
case in his interest . <unk> , being rather <unk> , has <unk> the case to me , and hence 
it is that two <unk> - <unk> gentlemen are <unk> <unk> at fifty <unk> an hour instead of quietly <unk> 
their <unk> at home ." " i am <unk> ," said i , " that the facts are so <unk> 
that you will find little <unk> to be <unk> out of this case ." " there is nothing more <unk> 
than an <unk> <unk> ," he answered , laughing . " besides , we may chance to <unk> upon some 
other <unk> facts which may have been by no means <unk> to mr . <unk> . you know me too 
well to think that i am <unk> when i say that i shall either <unk> or <unk> his <unk> by 
means which he is quite <unk> of employing , or even of <unk> . to take the first example to 
hand , i very <unk> <unk> that in your bedroom the window is upon the right - hand side , 
and yet i question whether mr . <unk> would have <unk> even so self - <unk> a thing as that 
." " how on <unk> --" " my dear fellow , i know you well . i know the <unk> 
<unk> which <unk> you . you <unk> every morning , and in this <unk> you <unk> by the <unk> ; 
but since your <unk> is less and less complete as we get <unk> back on the left side , until 
it becomes <unk> <unk> as we get round the <unk> of the <unk> , it is surely very clear that 
that side is less <unk> than the other . i could not imagine a man of your habits looking at 
himself in an <unk> light and being <unk> with such a result . i only <unk> this as a <unk> 
example of observation and <unk> . <unk> <unk> my <unk> © <unk> , and it is just <unk> that it 
may be of some <unk> in the investigation which <unk> before us . there are one or two <unk> <unk> 
which were brought out in the <unk> , and which are <unk> <unk> ." " what are they ?" " 
it appears that his arrest did not take <unk> at once , but after the return to <unk> <unk> . 
on the <unk> of <unk> <unk> him that he was a <unk> , he remarked that he was not <unk> 
to hear it , and that it was no more than his <unk> . this observation of his had the 
<unk> <unk> of <unk> any <unk> of doubt which might have remained in the <unk> of the <unk> ' s 
<unk> ." " it was a <unk> ," i <unk> . " no , for it was followed by a 
<unk> of <unk> ." " coming on the top of such a <unk> <unk> of <unk> , it was at 
least a most suspicious <unk> ." " on the contrary ," said holmes , " it is the <unk> <unk> 
which i can at present see in the clouds . however <unk> he might be , he could not be 
such an absolute <unk> as not to see that the circumstances were very black against him . had he appeared 
<unk> at his own arrest , or <unk> <unk> at it , i should have looked upon it as <unk> 
suspicious , because such surprise or <unk> would not be <unk> under the circumstances , and yet might <unk> to 
be the best <unk> to a <unk> man . his <unk> <unk> of the situation <unk> him as either an 
<unk> man , or else as a man of <unk> self - <unk> and <unk> . as to his <unk> 
about his <unk> , it was also not <unk> if you <unk> that he stood beside the dead <unk> of 
his <unk> , and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far <unk> his <unk> 
<unk> as to <unk> <unk> with him , and even , <unk> to the little girl whose <unk> is so 
important , to raise his hand as if to <unk> him . the self - <unk> and <unk> which are 
<unk> in his <unk> <unk> to me to be the signs of a <unk> mind rather than of a <unk> 
one ." i <unk> my head . " many men have been <unk> on far <unk> <unk> ," i remarked 
. " so they have . and many men have been <unk> <unk> ." " what is the young man 
' s own account of the matter ?" " it is , i am <unk> , not very <unk> to 
his <unk> , though there are one or two <unk> in it which are suggestive . you will find it 
here , and may read it for yourself ." he <unk> out from his <unk> a copy of the <unk> 
<unk> paper , and having turned down the sheet he <unk> out the <unk> in which the <unk> young man 
had given his own <unk> of what had <unk> . i <unk> myself down in the corner of the carriage 
and read it very carefully . it ran in this way : " mr . <unk> <unk> , the only 
<unk> of the <unk> , was then called and gave <unk> as <unk> : ' i had been away from 
home for three days at <unk> , and had only just returned upon the morning of last monday , the 
<unk> . my <unk> was <unk> from home at the time of my <unk> , and i was informed by 
the maid that he had driven over to <unk> with john <unk> , the groom . shortly after my return 
i heard the wheels of his <unk> in the <unk> , and , looking out of my window , i 
saw him get out and walk <unk> out of the <unk> , though i was not aware in which direction 
he was <unk> . i then took my <unk> and <unk> out in the direction of the boscombe <unk> , 
with the intention of <unk> the <unk> <unk> which is upon the other side . on my way i saw 
<unk> <unk> , the <unk> - <unk> , as he had <unk> in his <unk> ; but he is mistaken 
in <unk> that i was following my <unk> . i had no <unk> that he was in front of me 
. when about a hundred <unk> from the <unk> i heard a cry of " <unk> !" which was a 
usual signal between my <unk> and myself . i then hurried forward , and found him standing by the <unk> 
. he appeared to be much <unk> at <unk> me and asked me rather <unk> what i was doing there 
. a <unk> <unk> which led to high <unk> and almost to <unk> , for my <unk> was a man 
of a very <unk> <unk> . <unk> that his <unk> was <unk> <unk> , i left him and returned towards 
<unk> <unk> . i had not gone more than <unk> <unk> , however , when i heard a <unk> <unk> 
behind me , which caused me to run back again . i found my <unk> <unk> upon the ground , 
with his head <unk> injured . i dropped my <unk> and <unk> him in my arms , but he almost 
<unk> <unk> . i <unk> beside him for some minutes , and then made my way to mr . turner 
' s lodge - <unk> , his house being the <unk> , to <unk> for <unk> . i saw no 
one near my <unk> when i returned , and i have no <unk> how he came by his <unk> . 
he was not a <unk> man , being <unk> cold and <unk> in his <unk> , but he had , 
as far as i know , no active <unk> . i know nothing <unk> of the matter .' " the 
<unk> : did your <unk> make any <unk> to you before he <unk> ? " witness : he <unk> a 
few <unk> , but i could only catch some <unk> to a <unk> . " the <unk> : what did 
you understand by that ? " witness : it conveyed no <unk> to me . i thought that he was 
<unk> . " the <unk> : what was the point upon which you and your <unk> had this <unk> quarrel 
? " witness : i should prefer not to <unk> . " the <unk> : i am <unk> that i 
must press it . " witness : it is really <unk> for me to tell you . i can <unk> 
you that it has nothing to do with the <unk> tragedy which followed . " the <unk> : that is 
for the <unk> to <unk> . i need not point out to you that your <unk> to <unk> will <unk> 
your case <unk> in any future proceedings which may <unk> . " witness : i must still refuse . " 
the <unk> : i understand that the cry of ' <unk> ' was a <unk> signal between you and your 
<unk> ? " witness : it was . " the <unk> : how was it , then , that he 
<unk> it before he saw you , and before he even knew that you had returned from <unk> ? " 
witness ( with <unk> <unk> <unk> i do not know . " a <unk> : did you see nothing which 
<unk> your <unk> when you returned on <unk> the cry and found your <unk> <unk> injured ? " witness : 
nothing <unk> . " the <unk> : what do you mean ? " witness : i was so <unk> and 
<unk> as i rushed out into the open , that i could think of nothing except of my <unk> . 
yet i have a vague impression that as i ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of 
me . it seemed to me to be something <unk> in <unk> , a coat of some sort , or 
a <unk> perhaps . when i rose from my <unk> i looked round for it , but it was gone 
. "' do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help ?' "' yes , it was gone 
.' "' you <unk> say what it was ?' "' no , i had a <unk> something was there .' 
"' how far from the <unk> ?' "' a dozen <unk> or so .' "' and how far from the 
<unk> of the wood ?' "' about the same .' "' then if it was <unk> it was while you 
were within a dozen <unk> of it ?' "' yes , but with my back towards it .' " this 
<unk> the <unk> of the witness ." " i see ," said i as i glanced down the <unk> , 
" that the <unk> in his <unk> <unk> was rather <unk> upon young <unk> . he calls attention , and 
with reason , to the <unk> about his <unk> having <unk> to him before <unk> him , also to his 
<unk> to give details of his <unk> with his <unk> , and his singular account of his <unk> ' s 
<unk> <unk> . they are all , as he <unk> , very much against the <unk> ." holmes laughed <unk> 
to himself and stretched himself out upon the <unk> seat . " both you and the <unk> have been at 
some <unk> ," said he , " to single out the very <unk> <unk> in the young man ' s 
<unk> . don ' t you see that you <unk> give him <unk> for having too much <unk> and too 
little ? too little , if he could not <unk> a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy 
of the <unk> ; too much , if he <unk> from his own inner <unk> anything so <unk> © as 
a <unk> <unk> to a <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> . no , sir , i 
shall <unk> this case from the point of view that what this young man <unk> is true , and we 
shall see <unk> that <unk> will lead us . and now here is my pocket <unk> , and not another 
word shall i say of this case until we are on the scene of action . we <unk> at <unk> 
, and i see that we shall be there in twenty minutes ." it was nearly four o ' clock 
when we at last , after passing through the beautiful <unk> valley , and over the broad <unk> <unk> , 
found ourselves at the pretty little country - <unk> of <unk> . a <unk> , <unk> - like man , 
<unk> and <unk> - looking , was waiting for us upon the <unk> . in <unk> of the light brown 
<unk> and leather - <unk> which he wore in <unk> to his <unk> <unk> , i had no <unk> in 
<unk> <unk> , of <unk> <unk> . with him we drove to the <unk> arms where a room had already 
been engaged for us . " i have <unk> a carriage ," said <unk> as we sat over a <unk> 
of <unk> . " i knew your energetic nature , and that you would not be <unk> until you had 
been on the scene of the crime ." " it was very nice and <unk> of you ," holmes answered 
. " it is entirely a question of <unk> <unk> ." <unk> looked startled . " i do not quite 
follow ," he said . " how is the glass ? twenty - <unk> , i see . no wind 
, and not a cloud in the <unk> . i have a <unk> of <unk> here which need smoking , 
and the sofa is very much <unk> to the usual country <unk> <unk> . i do not think that it 
is probable that i shall use the carriage to - night ." <unk> laughed <unk> . " you have , 
no doubt , already <unk> your <unk> from the <unk> ," he said . " the case is as <unk> 
as a <unk> , and the more one goes into it the <unk> it becomes . still , of course 
, one can ' t refuse a lady , and such a very <unk> one , too . she has 
heard of you , and would have your <unk> , though i <unk> told her that there was nothing which 
you could do which i had not already done . why , <unk> my soul ! here is her carriage 
at the door ." he had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young 
women that i have ever seen in my life . her <unk> eyes <unk> , her <unk> <unk> , a 
pink <unk> upon her <unk> , all thought of her <unk> <unk> lost in her overpowering <unk> and <unk> . 
" oh , mr . sherlock holmes !" she cried , glancing from one to the other of us , 
and finally , with a woman ' s quick <unk> , <unk> upon my companion , " i am so 
glad that you have come . i have driven down to tell you so . i know that <unk> <unk> 
' t do it . i know it , and i want you to start upon your work <unk> it 
, too . never let yourself doubt upon that point . we have known each other since we were little 
<unk> , and i know his <unk> as no one else does ; but he is too <unk> - <unk> 
to hurt a <unk> . such a <unk> is <unk> to anyone who really knows him ." " i hope 
we may clear him , miss turner ," said sherlock holmes . " you may rely upon my doing all 
that i can ." " but you have read the <unk> . you have <unk> some conclusion ? do you 
not see some <unk> , some <unk> ? do you not yourself think that he is <unk> ?" " i 
think that it is very probable ." " there , now !" she cried , throwing back her head and 
looking <unk> at <unk> . " you hear ! he gives me hopes ." <unk> shrugged his shoulders . " 
i am <unk> that my colleague has been a little quick in <unk> his <unk> ," he said . " 
but he is right . oh ! i know that he is right . <unk> never did it . and 
about his quarrel with his <unk> , i am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it 
to the <unk> was because i was <unk> in it ." " in what way ?" asked holmes . " 
it is no time for me to <unk> anything . <unk> and his <unk> had many <unk> about me . 
mr . <unk> was very <unk> that there should be a marriage between us . <unk> and i have always 
loved each other as <unk> and <unk> ; but of course he is young and has seen very little of 
life yet , and -- and -- well , he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet 
. so there were <unk> , and this , i am sure , was one of them ." " and 
your <unk> ?" asked holmes . " was he in <unk> of such a <unk> ?" " no , he 
was averse to it also . no one but mr . <unk> was in <unk> of it ." a quick 
<unk> passed over her fresh young face as holmes shot one of his keen , questioning <unk> at her . 
" thank you for this information ," said he . " may i see your <unk> if i call to 
- morrow ?" " i am <unk> the doctor won ' t <unk> it ." " the doctor ?" " 
yes , have you not heard ? poor <unk> has never been strong for years back , but this has 
broken him down completely . he has taken to his <unk> , and dr . <unk> <unk> that he is 
a <unk> and that his nervous system is <unk> . mr . <unk> was the only man <unk> who had 
known <unk> in the old days in <unk> ." " ha ! in <unk> ! that is important ." " 
yes , at the <unk> ." " quite so ; at the gold - <unk> , where , as i 
understand , mr . turner made his money ." " yes , certainly ." " thank you , miss turner 
. you have been of <unk> <unk> to me ." " you will tell me if you have any news 
to - morrow . no doubt you will go to the <unk> to see <unk> . oh , if you 
do , mr . holmes , do tell him that i know him to be <unk> ." " i will 
, miss turner ." " i must go home now , for <unk> is very ill , and he <unk> 
me so if i leave him . good - <unk> , and god help you in your <unk> ." she 
hurried from the room as <unk> as she had entered , and we heard the wheels of her carriage <unk> 
off down the street . " i am ashamed of you , holmes ," said <unk> with <unk> after a 
few minutes ' silence . " why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to <unk> ? i 
am not over - <unk> of heart , but i call it <unk> ." " i think that i see 
my way to clearing <unk> <unk> ," said holmes . " have you an order to see him in <unk> 
?" " yes , but only for you and me ." " then i shall <unk> my resolution about <unk> 
out . we have still time to take a train to <unk> and see him to - night ?" " 
<unk> ." " then let us do so . watson , i fear that you will find it very slow 
, but i shall only be away a <unk> of hours ." i walked down to the station with them 
, and then <unk> through the streets of the little <unk> , finally returning to the <unk> , where i 
lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a <unk> - <unk> <unk> . the <unk> <unk> of 
the story was so <unk> , however , when <unk> to the deep mystery through which we were <unk> , 
and i found my attention <unk> so <unk> from the action to the <unk> , that i at last <unk> 
it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a <unk> of the <unk> of the day . <unk> 
that this <unk> young man ' s story were absolutely true , then what <unk> thing , what absolutely <unk> 
and extraordinary <unk> could have <unk> between the time when he <unk> from his <unk> , and the moment when 
, drawn back by his <unk> , he rushed into the <unk> ? it was something <unk> and <unk> . 
what could it be ? might not the nature of the <unk> reveal something to my medical <unk> ? i 
rang the bell and called for the <unk> <unk> paper , which <unk> a <unk> account of the <unk> . 
in the <unk> ' s <unk> it was <unk> that the <unk> <unk> of the left <unk> <unk> and the 
left half of the <unk> <unk> had been <unk> by a heavy blow from a <unk> weapon . i marked 
the <unk> upon my own head . <unk> such a blow must have been struck from behind . that was 
to some <unk> in <unk> of the <unk> , as when seen <unk> he was face to face with his 
<unk> . still , it did not go for very much , for the <unk> man might have turned his 
back before the blow fell . still , it might be <unk> while to call holmes ' attention to it 
. then there was the peculiar <unk> <unk> to a <unk> . what could that mean ? it could not 
be <unk> . a man <unk> from a <unk> blow does not <unk> <unk> <unk> . no , it was 
more likely to be an attempt to explain how he <unk> his <unk> . but what could it <unk> ? 
i <unk> my <unk> to find some <unk> <unk> . and then the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> seen by 
young <unk> . if that were true the <unk> must have dropped some part of his dress , presumably his 
<unk> , in his flight , and must have had the <unk> to return and to carry it away at 
the instant when the <unk> was <unk> with his back turned not a dozen <unk> off . what a <unk> 
of mysteries and <unk> the whole thing was ! i did not wonder at <unk> ' s <unk> , and 
yet i had so much <unk> in sherlock holmes ' <unk> that i could not lose hope as long as 
every fresh <unk> seemed to <unk> his <unk> of young <unk> ' s <unk> . it was late before sherlock 
holmes returned . he came back alone , for <unk> was <unk> in lodgings in the <unk> . " the 
glass still <unk> very high ," he remarked as he sat down . " it is of importance that it 
should not <unk> before we are able to go over the ground . on the other hand , a man 
should be at his very best and <unk> for such nice work as that , and i did not wish 
to do it when <unk> by a long journey . i have seen young <unk> ." " and what did 
you <unk> from him ?" " nothing ." " could he throw no light ?" " none at all . 
i was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was <unk> him or 
her , but i am <unk> now that he is as <unk> as everyone else . he is not a 
very quick - <unk> youth , though <unk> to look at and , i should think , sound at heart 
." " i <unk> <unk> his taste ," i remarked , " if it is indeed a <unk> that he 
was averse to a marriage with so <unk> a young lady as this miss turner ." " ah , <unk> 
<unk> a rather <unk> <unk> . this fellow is <unk> , <unk> , in love with her , but some 
two years ago , when he was only a <unk> , and before he really knew her , for she 
had been away five years at a <unk> - <unk> , what does the <unk> do but get into the 
<unk> of a <unk> in <unk> and marry her at a <unk> <unk> ? no one knows a word of 
the matter , but you can imagine how <unk> it must be to him to be <unk> for not doing 
what he would give his very eyes to do , but what he knows to be absolutely <unk> . it 
was <unk> <unk> of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his <unk> , 
at their last <unk> , was <unk> him on to propose to miss turner . on the other hand , 
he had no means of <unk> himself , and his <unk> , who was by all <unk> a very hard 
man , would have thrown him over <unk> had he known the <unk> . it was with his <unk> wife 
that he had <unk> the last three days in <unk> , and his <unk> did not know where he was 
. mark that point . it is of importance . good has come out of evil , however , for 
the <unk> , <unk> from the papers that he is in serious <unk> and likely to be <unk> , has 
thrown him over <unk> and has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the <unk> 
<unk> , so that there is really no tie between them . i think that that bit of news has 
<unk> young <unk> for all that he has <unk> ." " but if he is <unk> , who has done 
it ?" " ah ! who ? i would call your attention very particularly to two <unk> . one is 
that the <unk> man had an <unk> with someone at the <unk> , and that the someone could not have 
been his <unk> , for his <unk> was away , and he did not know when he would return . 
the second is that the <unk> man was heard to cry ' <unk> !' before he knew that his <unk> 
had returned . those are the <unk> <unk> upon which the case <unk> . and now let us <unk> about 
<unk> <unk> , if you please , and we shall leave all <unk> matters until to - morrow ." there 
was no <unk> , as holmes had <unk> , and the morning broke <unk> and <unk> . at <unk> o 
' clock <unk> called for us with the carriage , and we <unk> off for <unk> <unk> and the boscombe 
<unk> . " there is serious news this morning ," <unk> observed . " it is said that mr . 
turner , of the hall , is so ill that his life is <unk> of ." " an elderly man 
, i <unk> ?" said holmes . " about <unk> ; but his <unk> has been <unk> by his life 
<unk> , and he has been in failing <unk> for some time . this business has had a very bad 
<unk> upon him . he was an old friend of <unk> ' s , and , i may <unk> , 
a great <unk> to him , for i have <unk> that he gave him <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ." " 
indeed ! that is interesting ," said holmes . " oh , yes ! in a hundred other <unk> he 
has <unk> him . <unk> about here <unk> of his <unk> to him ." " really ! does it not 
<unk> you as a little singular that this <unk> , who appears to have had little of his own , 
and to have been under such <unk> to turner , should still <unk> of <unk> his <unk> to turner ' 
s daughter , who is , presumably , <unk> to the <unk> , and that in such a very <unk> 
manner , as if it were merely a case of a <unk> and all else would follow ? it is 
the more strange , since we know that turner himself was averse to the <unk> . the daughter told us 
as much . do you not deduce something from that ?" " we have got to the <unk> and the 
<unk> ," said <unk> , <unk> at me . " i find it hard enough to <unk> facts , holmes 
, without <unk> away after theories and <unk> ." " you are right ," said holmes <unk> ; " you 
do find it very hard to <unk> the facts ." " <unk> , i have <unk> one <unk> which you 
<unk> to find it difficult to get hold of ," <unk> <unk> with some <unk> . " and that is 
--" " that <unk> <unk> <unk> his death from <unk> <unk> and that all theories to the contrary are the 
<unk> <unk> ." " well , <unk> is a <unk> thing than <unk> ," said holmes , laughing . " 
but i am very much mistaken if this is not <unk> <unk> upon the left ." " yes , that 
is it ." it was a <unk> , comfortable - looking <unk> , two - <unk> , <unk> - <unk> 
, with great <unk> <unk> of <unk> upon the <unk> <unk> . the drawn blinds and the <unk> <unk> , 
however , gave it a <unk> look , as though the weight of this <unk> still lay heavy upon it 
. we called at the door , when the maid , at holmes ' <unk> , showed us the boots 
which her master wore at the time of his death , and also a pair of the <unk> ' s 
, though not the pair which he had then had . having <unk> these very carefully from seven or eight 
different <unk> , holmes <unk> to be led to the <unk> - <unk> , from which we all followed the 
<unk> <unk> which led to boscombe <unk> . sherlock holmes was <unk> when he was hot upon such a scent 
as this . men who had only known the quiet <unk> and <unk> of baker street would have failed to 
<unk> him . his face flushed and <unk> . his <unk> were drawn into two hard black <unk> , while 
his eyes <unk> out from <unk> them with a <unk> <unk> . his face was <unk> <unk> , his shoulders 
<unk> , his <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> stood out like <unk> in his long , <unk> neck . 
his <unk> seemed to <unk> with a <unk> <unk> <unk> for the <unk> , and his mind was so absolutely 
<unk> upon the matter before him that a question or <unk> fell <unk> upon his <unk> , or , at 
the most , only <unk> a quick , <unk> <unk> in <unk> . swiftly and <unk> he made his way 
<unk> the <unk> which ran through the <unk> , and so by way of the <unk> to the boscombe <unk> 
. it was <unk> , <unk> ground , as is all that <unk> , and there were <unk> of many 
feet , both upon the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> <unk> which <unk> it on either side . <unk> holmes 
would hurry on , <unk> <unk> dead , and once he made quite a little <unk> into the <unk> . 
<unk> and i walked behind him , the <unk> <unk> and <unk> , while i watched my friend with the 
interest which sprang from the <unk> that every one of his actions was <unk> towards a <unk> end . the 
boscombe <unk> , which is a little <unk> - <unk> sheet of <unk> some fifty <unk> across , is <unk> 
at the <unk> between the <unk> <unk> and the private park of the <unk> mr . turner . above the 
<unk> which lined it upon the <unk> side we could see the red , <unk> <unk> which marked the <unk> 
of the rich <unk> ' s <unk> . on the <unk> side of the <unk> the <unk> <unk> very thick 
, and there was a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> twenty <unk> across between the <unk> of the <unk> and 
the <unk> which lined the <unk> . <unk> showed us the <unk> <unk> at which the <unk> had been found 
, and , indeed , so moist was the ground , that i could plainly see the <unk> which had 
been left by the fall of the <unk> man . to holmes , as i could see by his <unk> 
face and peering eyes , very many other things were to be read upon the <unk> <unk> . he ran 
round , like a <unk> who is <unk> up a scent , and then turned upon my companion . " 
what did you go into the <unk> for ?" he asked . " i <unk> about with a <unk> . 
i thought there might be some weapon or other <unk> . but how on <unk> --" " oh , <unk> 
, <unk> ! i have no time ! that left <unk> of yours with its <unk> twist is all over 
the <unk> . a <unk> could <unk> it , and there it <unk> among the <unk> . oh , how 
simple it would all have been had i been here before they came like a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> 
all over it . here is where the <unk> with the lodge - <unk> came , and they have <unk> 
all <unk> for six or eight feet round the <unk> . but here are three <unk> <unk> of the same 
feet ." he drew out a <unk> and lay down upon his <unk> to have a better view , talking 
all the time rather to himself than to us . " these are young <unk> ' s feet . twice 
he was walking , and once he ran swiftly , so that the <unk> are deeply marked and the heels 
hardly visible . that <unk> out his story . he ran when he saw his <unk> on the ground . 
then here are the <unk> ' s feet as he paced up and down . what is this , then 
? it is the <unk> - end of the <unk> as the <unk> stood <unk> . and this ? ha 
, ha ! what have we here ? <unk> ! <unk> ! <unk> , too , quite unusual boots ! 
they come , they go , they come again -- of course that was for the cloak . now where 
did they come from ?" he ran up and down , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> the <unk> until we 
were well within the <unk> of the wood and under the shadow of a great <unk> , the <unk> <unk> 
in the neighbourhood . holmes <unk> his way to the <unk> side of this and lay down once more upon 
his face with a little cry of satisfaction . for a long time he remained there , <unk> over the 
<unk> and <unk> sticks , <unk> up what seemed to me to be <unk> into an <unk> and <unk> with 
his <unk> not only the ground but even the <unk> of the <unk> as far as he could reach . 
a <unk> <unk> was lying among the <unk> , and this also he carefully examined and <unk> . then he 
followed a <unk> through the wood until he came to the <unk> , where all <unk> were lost . " 
it has been a case of <unk> interest ," he remarked , returning to his <unk> manner . " i 
fancy that this <unk> house on the right must be the lodge . i think that i will go in 
and have a word with <unk> , and perhaps <unk> a little note . having done that , we may 
drive back to our <unk> . you may walk to the cab , and i shall be with you presently 
." it was about ten minutes before we <unk> our cab and drove back into <unk> , holmes still <unk> 
with him the <unk> which he had <unk> up in the wood . " this may interest you , <unk> 
," he remarked , <unk> it out . " the murder was done with it ." " i see no 
<unk> ." " there are none ." " how do you know , then ?" " the <unk> was <unk> 
under it . it had only <unk> there a few days . there was no sign of a <unk> whence 
it had been taken . it <unk> with the <unk> . there is no sign of any other weapon ." 
" and the <unk> ?" " is a tall man , left - handed , <unk> with the right <unk> 
, <unk> thick - <unk> <unk> - boots and a <unk> cloak , <unk> <unk> cigars , <unk> a cigar 
- <unk> , and carries a <unk> <unk> - <unk> in his pocket . there are several other <unk> , 
but these may be enough to <unk> us in our search ." <unk> laughed . " i am <unk> that 
i am still a <unk> ," he said . " theories are all very well , but we have to 
deal with a hard - headed <unk> <unk> ." " <unk> <unk> ," answered holmes <unk> . " you work 
your own <unk> , and i shall work mine . i shall be busy this afternoon , and shall probably 
return to london by the evening train ." " and leave your case <unk> ?" " no , finished ." 
" but the mystery ?" " it is <unk> ." " who was the <unk> , then ?" " the 
gentleman i <unk> ." " but who is he ?" " surely it would not be difficult to find out 
. this is not such a <unk> neighbourhood ." <unk> shrugged his shoulders . " i am a <unk> man 
," he said , " and i really <unk> <unk> to go about the country looking for a left - 
handed gentleman with a <unk> <unk> . i should <unk> the laughing - <unk> of <unk> <unk> ." " all 
right ," said holmes quietly . " i have given you the chance . here are your lodgings . good 
- <unk> . i shall drop you a line before i leave ." having left <unk> at his rooms , 
we drove to our <unk> , where we found <unk> upon the table . holmes was <unk> and buried in 
thought with a <unk> expression upon his face , as one who finds himself in a <unk> position . " 
look here , watson ," he said when the <unk> was <unk> " just sit down in this chair and 
let me <unk> to you for a little . i don ' t know quite what to do , and 
i should <unk> your <unk> . light a cigar and let me <unk> ." " pray do so ." " 
well , now , in <unk> this case there are two <unk> about young <unk> ' s <unk> which struck 
us both <unk> , <unk> they <unk> me in his <unk> and you against him . one was the <unk> 
that his <unk> should , <unk> to his account , cry ' <unk> !' before <unk> him . the other 
was his singular <unk> <unk> to a <unk> . he <unk> several <unk> , you understand , but that was 
all that caught the <unk> ' s ear . now from this double point our <unk> must <unk> , and 
we will begin it by <unk> that what the <unk> <unk> is absolutely true ." " what of this ' 
<unk> !' then ?" " well , obviously it could not have been <unk> for the <unk> . the <unk> 
, as far as he knew , was in <unk> . it was <unk> chance that he was within <unk> 
. the ' <unk> !' was <unk> to <unk> the attention of <unk> it was that he had the <unk> 
with . but ' <unk> ' is a <unk> <unk> cry , and one which is <unk> between <unk> . 
there is a strong <unk> that the person whom <unk> expected to meet him at boscombe <unk> was someone who 
had been in <unk> ." " what of the <unk> , then ?" sherlock holmes took a <unk> paper from 
his pocket and <unk> it out on the table . " this is a <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> 
," he said . " i <unk> to <unk> for it last night ." he put his hand over part 
of the <unk> . " what do you read ?" " <unk> ," i read . " and now ?" 
he raised his hand . " <unk> ." " quite so . that was the word the man <unk> , 
and of which his <unk> only caught the last two <unk> . he was <unk> to <unk> the name of 
his <unk> . so and so , of <unk> ." " it is wonderful !" i <unk> . " it 
is <unk> . and now , you see , i had <unk> the field down <unk> . the <unk> of 
a <unk> <unk> was a <unk> point which , <unk> the <unk> ' s <unk> to be <unk> , was 
a <unk> . we have come now out of <unk> <unk> to the <unk> <unk> of an <unk> from <unk> 
with a <unk> cloak ." " certainly ." " and one who was at home in the <unk> , for 
the <unk> can only be <unk> by the <unk> or by the <unk> , where <unk> could hardly <unk> ." 
" quite so ." " then comes our <unk> of to - day . by an <unk> of the ground 
i <unk> the trifling details which i gave to that <unk> <unk> , as to the <unk> of the <unk> 
." " but how did you <unk> them ?" " you know my <unk> . it is <unk> upon the 
observation of <unk> ." " his height i know that you might <unk> <unk> from the length of his <unk> 
. his boots , too , might be told from their <unk> ." " yes , they were peculiar boots 
." " but his <unk> ?" " the impression of his right <unk> was always less <unk> than his left 
. he put less weight upon it . why ? because he <unk> -- he was <unk> ." " but 
his left - <unk> ." " you were yourself struck by the nature of the <unk> as recorded by the 
<unk> at the <unk> . the blow was struck from immediately behind , and yet was upon the left side 
. now , how can that be <unk> it were by a left - handed man ? he had stood 
behind that <unk> during the <unk> between the <unk> and <unk> . he had even <unk> there . i found 
the <unk> of a cigar , which my <unk> <unk> of tobacco <unk> <unk> me to pronounce as an <unk> 
cigar . i have , as you know , <unk> some attention to this , and written a little monograph 
on the <unk> of <unk> different <unk> of <unk> , cigar , and cigarette tobacco . having found the <unk> 
, i then looked round and <unk> the <unk> among the <unk> where he had tossed it . it was 
an <unk> cigar , of the <unk> which are rolled in <unk> ." " and the cigar - <unk> ?" 
" i could see that the end had not been in his mouth . therefore he <unk> a <unk> . 
the <unk> had been <unk> off , not <unk> off , but the <unk> was not a <unk> one , 
so i <unk> a <unk> <unk> - <unk> ." " holmes ," i said , " you have drawn a 
net round this man from which he <unk> <unk> , and you have saved an <unk> <unk> life as truly 
as if you had <unk> the <unk> which was hanging him . i see the direction in which all this 
<unk> . the <unk> is --" " mr . john turner ," cried the <unk> <unk> , opening the door 
of our sitting - room , and <unk> in a visitor . the man who entered was a strange and 
<unk> figure . his slow , <unk> step and <unk> shoulders gave the appearance of <unk> , and yet his 
hard , deep - lined , <unk> features , and his <unk> limbs showed that he was <unk> of unusual 
<unk> of <unk> and of character . his <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> 
to give an air of <unk> and power to his appearance , but his face was of an <unk> white 
, while his <unk> and the <unk> of his <unk> were <unk> with a <unk> of blue . it was 
clear to me at a glance that he was in the <unk> of some <unk> and <unk> <unk> . " 
pray sit down on the sofa ," said holmes <unk> . " you had my note ?" " yes , 
the lodge - <unk> brought it up . you said that you wished to see me here to <unk> scandal 
." " i thought people would <unk> if i went to the hall ." " and why did you wish 
to see me ?" he looked across at my companion with <unk> in his <unk> eyes , as though his 
question was already answered . " yes ," said holmes , <unk> the look rather than the <unk> . " 
it is so . i know all about <unk> ." the old man <unk> his face in his hands . 
" god help me !" he cried . " but i would not have let the young man come to 
<unk> . i give you my word that i would have spoken out if it went against him at the 
<unk> ." " i am glad to hear you say so ," said holmes <unk> . " i would have 
spoken now had it not been for my dear girl . it would <unk> her heart -- it will <unk> 
her heart when she <unk> that i am <unk> ." " it may not come to that ," said holmes 
. " what ?" " i am no official agent . i understand that it was your daughter who <unk> 
my <unk> here , and i am <unk> in her interests . young <unk> must be got off , however 
." " i am a <unk> man ," said old turner . " i have had <unk> for years . 
my doctor <unk> it is a question whether i shall <unk> a <unk> . yet i would rather die under 
my own <unk> than in a <unk> ." holmes rose and sat down at the table with his <unk> in 
his hand and a <unk> of paper before him . " just tell us the <unk> ," he said . 
" i shall <unk> down the facts . you will sign it , and watson here can witness it . 
then i could produce your <unk> at the last <unk> to save young <unk> . i promise you that i 
shall not use it <unk> it is absolutely <unk> ." " it ' s as well ," said the old 
man ; " it ' s a question whether i shall <unk> to the <unk> , so it matters little 
to me , but i should wish to spare <unk> the <unk> . and now i will make the thing 
clear to you ; it has been a long time in the <unk> , but will not take me long 
to tell . " you <unk> ' t know this dead man , <unk> . he was a devil <unk> 
. i tell you that . god keep you out of the <unk> of such a man as he . 
his <unk> has been upon me these twenty years , and he has <unk> my life . i ' ll 
tell you first how i came to be in his power . " it was in the <unk> ' <unk> 
' s at the <unk> . i was a young <unk> then , hot - <unk> and <unk> , <unk> 
to turn my hand at anything ; i got among bad <unk> , took to <unk> , had no <unk> 
with my <unk> , took to the <unk> , and in a word became what you would call over here 
a <unk> <unk> . there were six of us , and we had a <unk> , <unk> life of it 
, sticking up a station from time to time , or <unk> the <unk> on the road to the <unk> 
. black <unk> of <unk> was the name i went under , and our <unk> is still remembered in the 
<unk> as the <unk> gang . " one day a gold <unk> came down from <unk> to <unk> , and 
we lay in wait for it and <unk> it . there were six <unk> and six of us , so 
it was a close thing , but we <unk> four of their <unk> at the first <unk> . three of 
our <unk> were <unk> , however , before we got the <unk> . i put my <unk> to the head 
of the <unk> - driver , who was this very man <unk> . i wish to the <unk> that i 
had shot him then , but i <unk> him , though i saw his <unk> little eyes <unk> on my 
face , as though to remember every <unk> . we got away with the gold , became <unk> men , 
and made our way over to england without being suspected . there i <unk> from my old <unk> and determined 
to <unk> down to a quiet and respectable life . i bought this <unk> , which <unk> to be in 
the <unk> , and i <unk> myself to do a little good with my money , to make up for 
the way in which i had <unk> it . i married , too , and though my wife <unk> young 
she left me my dear little <unk> . even when she was just a baby her <unk> hand seemed to 
lead me down the right <unk> as nothing else had ever done . in a word , i turned over 
a new <unk> and did my best to make up for the past . all was <unk> well when <unk> 
laid his <unk> upon me . " i had gone up to <unk> about an <unk> , and i <unk> 
him in regent street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his <unk> . "' here 
we are , <unk> ,' <unk> he , <unk> me on the arm ; ' we ' ll be as 
good as a family to you . there ' s two of us , me and my <unk> , and 
you can have the keeping of us . if you don ' t -- it ' s a fine , 
law - <unk> country is england , and there ' s always a <unk> within <unk> .' " well , 
down they came to the <unk> country , there was no <unk> them off , and there they have lived 
<unk> <unk> on my best <unk> ever since . there was no rest for me , no peace , no 
<unk> ; turn where i would , there was his <unk> , <unk> face at my <unk> . it <unk> 
<unk> as <unk> <unk> up , for he soon saw i was more <unk> of her <unk> my past than 
of the police . whatever he wanted he must have , and whatever it was i gave him without question 
, <unk> , money , houses , until at last he asked a thing which i could not give . 
he asked for <unk> . " his <unk> , you see , had <unk> up , and so had my 
girl , and as i was known to be in <unk> <unk> , it seemed a fine <unk> to him 
that his <unk> should step into the whole <unk> . but there i was <unk> . i would not have 
his <unk> <unk> <unk> with mine ; not that i had any <unk> to the <unk> , but his blood 
was in him , and that was enough . i stood <unk> . <unk> <unk> . i <unk> him to 
do his <unk> . we were to meet at the <unk> <unk> between our houses to <unk> it over . 
" when i went down there i found him talking with his <unk> , so i <unk> a cigar and 
waited behind a <unk> until he should be alone . but as i listened to his <unk> all that was 
black and <unk> in me seemed to come <unk> . he was <unk> his <unk> to marry my daughter with 
as little <unk> for what she might think as if she were a <unk> from off the streets . it 
drove me mad to think that i and all that i <unk> most dear should be in the power of 
such a man as this . could i not <unk> the <unk> ? i was already a <unk> and a 
<unk> man . though clear of mind and <unk> strong of <unk> , i knew that my own <unk> was 
<unk> . but my memory and my girl ! both could be saved if i could but silence that <unk> 
<unk> . i did it , mr . holmes . i would do it again . deeply as i have 
<unk> , i have led a life of <unk> to <unk> for it . but that my girl should be 
entangled in the same <unk> which <unk> me was more than i could <unk> . i struck him down with 
no more compunction than if he had been some <unk> and <unk> <unk> . his cry brought back his <unk> 
; but i had <unk> the <unk> of the wood , though i was <unk> to go back to <unk> 
the cloak which i had dropped in my flight . that is the true story , gentlemen , of all 
that <unk> ." " well , it is not for me to <unk> you ," said holmes as the old 
man <unk> the <unk> which had been drawn out . " i pray that we may never be <unk> to 
such a <unk> ." " i pray not , sir . and what do you <unk> to do ?" " 
in view of your <unk> , nothing . you are yourself aware that you will soon have to <unk> for 
your <unk> at a <unk> <unk> than the <unk> . i will keep your <unk> , and if <unk> is 
<unk> i shall be <unk> to use it . if not , it shall never be seen by <unk> eye 
; and your secret , whether you be <unk> or dead , shall be safe with us ." " <unk> 
, then ," said the old man solemnly . " your own <unk> , when they come , will be 
the <unk> for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine ." <unk> and <unk> in all 
his <unk> <unk> , he <unk> slowly from the room . " god help us !" said holmes after a 
long silence . " why does <unk> play such <unk> with poor , helpless <unk> ? i never hear of 
such a case as this that i do not think of <unk> ' s <unk> , and say , ' 
there , but for the grace of god , goes sherlock holmes <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk> at the <unk> 
on the <unk> of a number of <unk> which had been drawn out by holmes and <unk> to the <unk> 
<unk> . old turner lived for seven months after our <unk> , but he is now dead ; and there 
is every <unk> that the <unk> and daughter may come to <unk> <unk> together in <unk> of the black cloud 
which <unk> upon their past . adventure v . the five orange pips when i glance over my notes and 
<unk> of the sherlock holmes cases between the years ' <unk> and ' <unk> , i am faced by so 
many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to <unk> and which 
to leave . some , however , have already <unk> <unk> through the papers , and others have not <unk> 
a field for those peculiar <unk> which my friend <unk> in so high a <unk> , and which it is 
the object of these papers to <unk> . some , too , have baffled his <unk> <unk> , and would 
be , as <unk> , <unk> without an <unk> , while others have been but <unk> <unk> up , and 
have their <unk> <unk> rather upon <unk> and <unk> than on that absolute <unk> <unk> which was so dear to 
him . there is , however , one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so 
<unk> in its results that i am <unk> to give some account of it in <unk> of the <unk> that 
there are <unk> in <unk> with it which never have been , and probably never will be , entirely <unk> 
up . the year ' <unk> furnished us with a long <unk> of cases of <unk> or less interest , 
of which i <unk> the <unk> . among my <unk> under this one twelve months i find an account of 
the adventure of the <unk> chamber , of the <unk> <unk> society , who <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the 
lower <unk> of a furniture <unk> , of the facts <unk> with the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> " <unk> 
<unk> <unk> of the singular adventures of the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> , and finally of the 
<unk> <unk> case . in the latter , as may be remembered , sherlock holmes was able , by <unk> 
up the dead man ' s watch , to prove that it had been <unk> up two hours before , 
and that therefore the <unk> had gone to <unk> within that time -- a deduction which was of the <unk> 
importance in clearing up the case . all these i may <unk> out at some future date , but none 
of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which i have now taken up my <unk> 
to <unk> . it was in the latter days of <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> had <unk> in with 
<unk> <unk> . all day the wind had <unk> and the <unk> had <unk> against the windows , so that 
even here in the heart of great , hand - made london we were <unk> to raise our <unk> for 
the instant from the <unk> of life and to <unk> the <unk> of those great <unk> <unk> which shriek at 
<unk> through the <unk> of his <unk> , like <unk> <unk> in a <unk> . as evening drew in , 
the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> , and the wind cried and <unk> like a child in the <unk> . 
sherlock holmes sat <unk> at one side of the <unk> cross - <unk> his <unk> of crime , while i 
at the other was deep in one of <unk> <unk> ' s fine sea - stories until the <unk> of 
the <unk> from without seemed to <unk> with the <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> to <unk> out 
into the long <unk> of the sea <unk> . my wife was on a visit to her <unk> ' s 
, and for a few days i was a <unk> once more in my old quarters at baker street . 
" why ," said i , glancing up at my companion , " that was surely the bell . who 
could come to - night ? some friend of yours , perhaps ?" " except yourself i have none ," 
he answered . " i do not <unk> <unk> ." " a client , then ?" " if so , 
it is a serious case . nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such 
an hour . but i take it that it is more likely to be some <unk> of the landlady ' 
s ." sherlock holmes was <unk> in his <unk> , however , for there came a step in the passage 
and a <unk> at the door . he stretched out his long arm to turn the <unk> away from himself 
and towards the <unk> chair upon which a <unk> must sit . " come in !" said he . the 
man who entered was young , some two - and - twenty at the outside , well - <unk> and 
<unk> <unk> , with something of <unk> and delicacy in his <unk> . the <unk> <unk> which he <unk> in 
his hand , and his long <unk> <unk> told of the fierce weather through which he had come . he 
looked about him <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> , and i could see that his face was <unk> 
and his eyes heavy , like those of a man who is <unk> down with some great anxiety . " 
i <unk> you an <unk> ," he said , <unk> his <unk> <unk> - <unk> to his eyes . " 
i trust that i am not <unk> . i fear that i have brought some <unk> of the <unk> and 
<unk> into your <unk> chamber ." " give me your coat and <unk> ," said holmes . " they may 
rest here on the <unk> and will be <unk> presently . you have come up from the <unk> - <unk> 
, i see ." " yes , from <unk> ." " that <unk> and <unk> <unk> which i see upon 
your <unk> <unk> is quite <unk> ." " i have come for <unk> ." " that is easily got ." 
" and help ." " that is not always so easy ." " i have heard of you , mr 
. holmes . i heard from <unk> <unk> how you saved him in the <unk> <unk> scandal ." " ah 
, of course . he was <unk> <unk> of <unk> at <unk> ." " he said that you could <unk> 
anything ." " he said too much ." " that you are never <unk> ." " i have been <unk> 
four times -- three times by men , and once by a woman ." " but what is that <unk> 
with the number of your <unk> ?" " it is true that i have been generally successful ." " then 
you may be so with me ." " i <unk> that you will draw your chair up to the fire 
and <unk> me with some details as to your case ." " it is no ordinary one ." " none 
of those which come to me are . i am the last <unk> of <unk> ." " and yet i 
question , sir , whether , in all your <unk> , you have ever listened to a more <unk> and 
<unk> chain of <unk> than those which have <unk> in my own family ." " you <unk> me with interest 
," said holmes . " pray give us the <unk> facts from the <unk> , and i can afterwards question 
you as to those details which <unk> to me to be most important ." the young man pulled his chair 
up and pushed his wet feet out towards the <unk> . " my name ," said he , " is 
john <unk> , but my own affairs have , as far as i can understand , little to do with 
this <unk> business . it is a hereditary matter ; so in order to give you an <unk> of the 
facts , i must go back to the <unk> of the <unk> . " you must know that my <unk> 
had two <unk> -- my <unk> <unk> and my <unk> <unk> . my <unk> had a small <unk> at <unk> 
, which he <unk> at the time of the <unk> of <unk> . he was a <unk> of the <unk> 
<unk> <unk> , and his business <unk> with such success that he was able to sell it and to <unk> 
upon a handsome <unk> . " my <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> when he was a young man and became 
a <unk> in <unk> , where he was <unk> to have done very well . at the time of the 
<unk> he <unk> in <unk> ' s <unk> , and afterwards under <unk> , where he rose to be a 
<unk> . when <unk> laid down his arms my <unk> returned to his <unk> , where he remained for three 
or four years . about <unk> or <unk> he came back to europe and took a small <unk> in <unk> 
, near <unk> . he had made a very <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , and his reason for <unk> 
them was his <unk> to the <unk> , and his <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in extending the <unk> to 
them . he was a singular man , fierce and quick - <unk> , very <unk> - <unk> when he 
was <unk> , and of a most <unk> <unk> . during all the years that he lived at <unk> , 
i doubt if ever he <unk> <unk> in the <unk> . he had a garden and two or three <unk> 
round his house , and there he would take his <unk> , though very often for <unk> on end he 
would never leave his room . he <unk> a great deal of <unk> and <unk> very <unk> , but he 
would see no society and did not want any <unk> , not even his own <unk> . " he <unk> 
' t mind me ; in <unk> , he took a fancy to me , for at the time when 
he saw me first i was a <unk> of twelve or so . this would be in the year <unk> 
, after he had been eight or <unk> years in england . he <unk> my <unk> to let me <unk> 
with him and he was very kind to me in his way . when he was <unk> he <unk> to 
be <unk> of playing <unk> and <unk> with me , and he would make me his <unk> both with the 
<unk> and with the <unk> , so that by the time that i was <unk> i was quite master of 
the house . i <unk> all the <unk> and could go where i <unk> and do what i <unk> , 
so long as i did not <unk> him in his <unk> . there was one singular <unk> , however , 
for he had a single room , a <unk> - room up among the <unk> , which was <unk> <unk> 
, and which he would never <unk> either me or anyone else to enter . with a boy ' s 
curiosity i have <unk> through the <unk> , but i was never able to see more than such a <unk> 
of old <unk> and <unk> as would be expected in such a room . " one day -- it was 
in march , <unk> -- a letter with a <unk> <unk> lay upon the table in front of the <unk> 
' s <unk> . it was not a <unk> thing for him to <unk> letters , for his <unk> were 
all paid in <unk> money , and he had no <unk> of any sort . ' from <unk> !' said 
he as he took it up , ' <unk> <unk> ! what can this be ?' opening it hurriedly , 
out there jumped five little <unk> orange pips , which <unk> down upon his <unk> . i began to <unk> 
at this , but the <unk> was struck from my <unk> at the <unk> of his face . his lip 
had <unk> , his eyes were <unk> , his <unk> the <unk> of <unk> , and he <unk> at the 
<unk> which he still <unk> in his <unk> hand , ' <unk> . <unk> . <unk> <unk> he <unk> , 
and then , ' my god , my god , my <unk> have <unk> me !' "' what is it 
, <unk> ?' i cried . "' death ,' said he , and <unk> from the table he retired to 
his room , <unk> me <unk> with <unk> . i took up the <unk> and saw <unk> in red <unk> 
upon the inner <unk> , just above the <unk> , the letter <unk> three times repeated . there was nothing 
else save the five <unk> pips . what could be the reason of his overpowering <unk> ? i left the 
<unk> - table , and as i <unk> the <unk> i <unk> him coming down with an old <unk> key 
, which must have <unk> to the <unk> , in one hand , and a small <unk> box , like 
a <unk> , in the other . "' they may do what they like , but i ' ll <unk> 
them still ,' said he with an <unk> . ' tell mary that i shall want a fire in my 
room to - day , and send down to <unk> , the <unk> lawyer .' " i did as he 
<unk> , and when the lawyer arrived i was asked to step up to the room . the fire was 
<unk> <unk> , and in the <unk> there was a <unk> of black , <unk> <unk> , as of burned 
paper , while the <unk> box stood open and empty beside it . as i glanced at the box i 
<unk> , with a start , that upon the <unk> was <unk> the <unk> <unk> which i had read in 
the morning upon the <unk> . "' i wish you , john ,' said my <unk> , ' to witness 
my will . i leave my <unk> , with all its advantages and all its <unk> , to my <unk> 
, your <unk> , whence it will , no doubt , <unk> to you . if you can <unk> it 
in peace , well and good ! if you find you <unk> , take my <unk> , my boy , 
and leave it to your <unk> <unk> . i am sorry to give you such a two - edged thing 
, but i can ' t say what turn things are <unk> to take . kindly sign the paper where 
mr . <unk> <unk> you .' " i <unk> the paper as <unk> , and the lawyer took it away 
with him . the singular <unk> made , as you may think , the deepest impression upon me , and 
i <unk> over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it 
. yet i could not shake off the vague <unk> of <unk> which it left behind , though the <unk> 
<unk> less keen as the <unk> passed and nothing <unk> to <unk> the usual <unk> of our lives . i 
could see a change in my <unk> , however . he <unk> more than ever , and he was less 
inclined for any sort of society . most of his time he would <unk> in his room , with the 
door <unk> upon the inside , but <unk> he would <unk> in a sort of drunken <unk> and would <unk> 
out of the house and <unk> about the garden with a <unk> in his hand , <unk> out that he 
was <unk> of no man , and that he was not to be <unk> up , like a <unk> in 
a <unk> , by man or devil . when these hot <unk> were over , however , he would rush 
<unk> in at the door and lock and <unk> it behind him , like a man who can <unk> it 
out no <unk> against the <unk> which <unk> at the <unk> of his soul . at such times i have 
seen his face , even on a cold day , <unk> with <unk> , as though it were new raised 
from a <unk> . " well , to come to an end of the matter , mr . holmes , 
and not to <unk> your <unk> , there came a night when he made one of those drunken <unk> from 
which he never came back . we found him , when we went to search for him , face <unk> 
in a little <unk> - <unk> <unk> , which lay at the <unk> of the garden . there was no 
sign of any <unk> , and the <unk> was but two feet deep , so that the <unk> , having 
<unk> to his known <unk> , brought in a <unk> of ' <unk> .' but i , who knew how 
he <unk> from the very thought of death , had much <unk> to <unk> myself that he had gone out 
of his way to meet it . the matter passed , however , and my <unk> entered into <unk> of 
the <unk> , and of some <unk> , <unk> pounds , which lay to his <unk> at the <unk> ." 
" one moment ," holmes <unk> , " your <unk> is , i <unk> , one of the most remarkable 
to which i have ever listened . let me have the date of the <unk> by your <unk> of the 
letter , and the date of his <unk> <unk> ." " the letter arrived on march <unk> , <unk> . 
his death was seven <unk> later , upon the night of may <unk> ." " thank you . pray <unk> 
." " when my <unk> took over the <unk> <unk> , he , at my <unk> , made a <unk> 
<unk> of the <unk> , which had been always <unk> up . we found the <unk> box there , <unk> 
its <unk> had been <unk> . on the inside of the <unk> was a paper <unk> , with the <unk> 
of <unk> . <unk> . <unk> . repeated upon it , and ' letters , <unk> , <unk> , and 
a <unk> ' written <unk> . these , we <unk> , indicated the nature of the papers which had been 
<unk> by <unk> <unk> . for the rest , there was nothing of much importance in the <unk> save a 
great many scattered papers and note - books <unk> upon my <unk> ' s life in <unk> . some of 
them were of the <unk> time and showed that he had done his <unk> well and had borne the <unk> 
of a brave <unk> . others were of a date during the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , and were 
<unk> <unk> with <unk> , for he had evidently taken a strong part in <unk> the <unk> - bag <unk> 
who had been sent down from the <unk> . " well , it was the <unk> of ' <unk> when 
my <unk> came to <unk> at <unk> , and all went as well as <unk> with us until the <unk> 
of ' <unk> . on the <unk> day after the new year i heard my <unk> give a sharp cry 
of surprise as we sat together at the <unk> - table . there he was , sitting with a <unk> 
opened <unk> in one hand and five <unk> orange pips in the <unk> palm of the other one . he 
had always laughed at what he called my <unk> - and - <unk> story about the <unk> , but he 
looked very <unk> and <unk> now that the same thing had come upon himself . "' why , what on 
<unk> does this mean , john ?' he <unk> . " my heart had turned to lead . ' it 
is <unk> . <unk> . <unk> <unk> said i . " he looked inside the <unk> . ' so it 
is ,' he cried . ' here are the very letters . but what is this written above them ?' 
"' put the papers on the <unk> ,' i read , <unk> over his shoulder . "' what papers ? 
what <unk> ?' he asked . "' the <unk> in the garden . there is no other ,' said i 
; ' but the papers must be those that are <unk> .' "' pooh !' said he , <unk> hard 
at his <unk> . ' we are in a <unk> <unk> here , and we can ' t have <unk> 
of this kind . where does the thing come from ?' "' from <unk> ,' i answered , glancing at 
the <unk> . "' some preposterous <unk> <unk> ,' said he . ' what have i to do with <unk> 
and papers ? i shall take no notice of such <unk> .' "' i should certainly speak to the police 
,' i said . "' and be laughed at for my <unk> . nothing of the sort .' "' then 
let me do so ?' "' no , i <unk> you . i won ' t have a <unk> made 
about such <unk> .' " it was in <unk> to <unk> with him , for he was a very <unk> 
man . i went about , however , with a heart which was <unk> of <unk> . " on the 
<unk> day after the coming of the letter my <unk> went from home to visit an old friend of his 
, <unk> <unk> , who is in <unk> of one of the <unk> upon <unk> <unk> . i was glad 
that he should go , for it seemed to me that he was <unk> from <unk> when he was away 
from home . in that , however , i was in <unk> . upon the second day of his <unk> 
i received a <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> me to come at once . my <unk> had <unk> over 
one of the deep <unk> - <unk> which <unk> in the neighbourhood , and was lying <unk> , with a 
<unk> <unk> . i hurried to him , but he passed away without having ever recovered his <unk> . he 
had , as it appears , been returning from <unk> in the <unk> , and as the country was unknown 
to him , and the <unk> - <unk> <unk> , the <unk> had no <unk> in <unk> in a <unk> 
of ' death from <unk> <unk> .' carefully as i examined every <unk> <unk> with his death , i was 
<unk> to find anything which could <unk> the <unk> of murder . there were no signs of <unk> , no 
<unk> , no <unk> , no <unk> of <unk> having been seen upon the <unk> . and yet i need 
not tell you that my mind was far from at ease , and that i was well - <unk> certain 
that some <unk> <unk> had been woven round him . " in this <unk> way i came into my <unk> 
. you will <unk> me why i did not <unk> of it ? i <unk> , because i was well 
<unk> that our <unk> were in some way <unk> upon an <unk> in my <unk> ' s life , and 
that the <unk> would be as <unk> in one house as in another . " it was in <unk> , 
' <unk> , that my poor <unk> <unk> his end , and two years and eight months have <unk> since 
then . during that time i have lived <unk> at <unk> , and i had <unk> to hope that this 
<unk> had passed away from the family , and that it had ended with the last <unk> . i had 
<unk> to take <unk> too soon , however ; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very <unk> in which 
it had come upon my <unk> ." the young man took from his <unk> a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> 
to the table he <unk> out upon it five little <unk> orange pips . " this is the <unk> ," 
he continued . " the <unk> is london -- <unk> <unk> . within are the very <unk> which were upon 
my <unk> ' s last <unk> : ' <unk> . <unk> . <unk> <unk> and then ' put the papers 
on the <unk> <unk> " what have you done ?" asked holmes . " nothing ." " nothing ?" " 
to tell the <unk> <unk> he <unk> his face into his <unk> , white hands --" i have felt helpless 
. i have felt like one of those poor <unk> when the <unk> is <unk> towards it . i <unk> 
to be in the grasp of some <unk> , <unk> evil , which no <unk> and no <unk> can <unk> 
against ." " <unk> ! <unk> !" cried sherlock holmes . " you must <unk> , man , or you 
are lost . nothing but energy can save you . this is no time for <unk> ." " i have 
seen the police ." " ah !" " but they listened to my story with a smile . i am 
<unk> that the <unk> has <unk> the <unk> that the letters are all <unk> <unk> , and that the <unk> 
of my <unk> were really <unk> , as the <unk> <unk> , and were not to be <unk> with the 
<unk> ." holmes <unk> his <unk> hands in the air . " <unk> <unk> !" he cried . " they 
have , however , <unk> me a <unk> , who may remain in the house with me ." " has 
he come with you to - night ?" " no . his orders were to stay in the house ." 
again holmes <unk> in the air . " why did you come to me ," he cried , " and 
, above all , why did you not come at once ?" " i did not know . it was 
only to - day that i spoke to <unk> <unk> about my <unk> and was <unk> by him to come 
to you ." " it is really two days since you had the letter . we should have <unk> before 
this . you have no <unk> <unk> , i suppose , than that which you have placed before us -- 
no suggestive <unk> which might help us ?" " there is one thing ," said john <unk> . he <unk> 
in his coat pocket , and , drawing out a <unk> of <unk> , blue - tinted paper , he 
laid it out upon the table . " i have some <unk> ," said he , " that on the 
day when my <unk> burned the papers i observed that the small , <unk> <unk> which lay <unk> the <unk> 
were of this <unk> <unk> . i found this single sheet upon the floor of his room , and i 
am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has , perhaps , <unk> out from 
among the others , and in that way has escaped <unk> . beyond the mention of pips , i do 
not see that it <unk> us much . i think myself that it is a <unk> from some private <unk> 
. the writing is <unk> my <unk> ' s ." holmes <unk> the <unk> , and we both <unk> over 
the sheet of paper , which showed by its <unk> <unk> that it had indeed been <unk> from a book 
. it was headed , " march , <unk> ," and <unk> were the following <unk> <unk> : " <unk> 
. <unk> came . same old <unk> . " <unk> . <unk> the pips on <unk> , <unk> , and 
john <unk> , of st . <unk> . " <unk> . <unk> <unk> . " <unk> . john <unk> <unk> 
. " <unk> . <unk> <unk> . all well ." " thank you !" said holmes , <unk> up the 
paper and returning it to our visitor . " and now you must on no account lose another instant . 
we <unk> spare time even to discuss what you have told me . you must get home <unk> and <unk> 
." " what shall i do ?" " there is but one thing to do . it must be done 
at once . you must put this <unk> of paper which you have shown us into the <unk> box which 
you have <unk> . you must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned 
by your <unk> , and that this is the only one which remains . you must <unk> that in such 
<unk> as will carry <unk> with them . having done this , you must at once put the box out 
upon the <unk> , as <unk> . do you understand ?" " entirely ." " do not think of <unk> 
, or anything of the sort , at present . i think that we may <unk> that by means of 
the law ; but we have our <unk> to <unk> , while <unk> is already woven . the first <unk> 
is to remove the <unk> <unk> which threatens you . the second is to clear up the mystery and to 
<unk> the <unk> <unk> ." " i thank you ," said the young man , <unk> and <unk> on his 
<unk> . " you have given me fresh life and hope . i shall certainly do as you advise ." 
" do not lose an instant . and , above all , take care of yourself in the <unk> , 
for i do not think that there can be a doubt that you are <unk> by a very <unk> and 
<unk> <unk> . how do you go back ?" " by train from <unk> ." " it is not yet 
<unk> . the streets will be crowded , so i trust that you may be in <unk> . and yet 
you <unk> <unk> yourself too closely ." " i am <unk> ." " that is well . to - morrow 
i shall <unk> to work upon your case ." " i shall see you at <unk> , then ?" " 
no , your secret <unk> in london . it is there that i shall <unk> it ." " then i 
shall call upon you in a day , or in two days , with news as to the box and 
the papers . i shall take your <unk> in every <unk> ." he <unk> hands with us and took his 
leave . outside the wind still <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and <unk> against the windows . this strange , 
<unk> story seemed to have come to us from <unk> the mad <unk> -- <unk> in upon us like a 
sheet of sea - <unk> in a <unk> -- and now to have been <unk> by them once more . 
sherlock holmes sat for some time in silence , with his head sunk forward and his eyes <unk> upon the 
red <unk> of the fire . then he lit his <unk> , and <unk> back in his chair he watched 
the blue smoke - <unk> as they <unk> each other up to the <unk> . " i think , watson 
," he remarked at last , " that of all our cases we have had none more <unk> than this 
." " save , perhaps , the sign of four ." " well , yes . save , perhaps , 
that . and yet this john <unk> seems to me to be walking <unk> even <unk> <unk> than did the 
<unk> ." " but have you ," i asked , " <unk> any <unk> <unk> as to what these <unk> 
are ?" " there can be no question as to their nature ," he answered . " then what are 
they ? who is this <unk> . <unk> . <unk> <unk> and why does he <unk> this <unk> family ?" 
sherlock holmes <unk> his eyes and placed his <unk> upon the arms of his chair , with his <unk> - 
<unk> together . " the <unk> reasoner ," he remarked , " would , when he had once been shown 
a single <unk> in all its <unk> , deduce from it not only all the chain of <unk> which led 
up to it but also all the results which would follow from it . as <unk> could <unk> <unk> a 
whole <unk> by the <unk> of a single <unk> , so the observer who has thoroughly <unk> one <unk> in 
a <unk> of incidents should be able to <unk> state all the other <unk> , both before and after . 
we have not yet <unk> the results which the reason alone can <unk> to . problems may be <unk> in 
the study which have baffled all those who have <unk> a <unk> by the <unk> of their <unk> . to 
carry the <unk> , however , to its <unk> <unk> , it is <unk> that the reasoner should be able 
to <unk> all the facts which have come to his <unk> ; and this in itself <unk> , as you 
will <unk> see , a <unk> of all <unk> , which , even in these days of <unk> <unk> and 
<unk> , is a <unk> <unk> <unk> . it is not so <unk> , however , that a man should 
possess all <unk> which is likely to be <unk> to him in his work , and this i have <unk> 
in my case to do . if i remember <unk> , you on one occasion , in the <unk> days 
of our <unk> , <unk> my <unk> in a very precise fashion ." " yes ," i answered , laughing 
. " it was a singular <unk> . <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> were marked at <unk> , i 
remember . <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> as <unk> the mud - <unk> from any <unk> within fifty <unk> of 
<unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and crime <unk> <unk> , <unk> - <unk> , <unk> 
, <unk> , lawyer , and self - <unk> by cocaine and tobacco . those , i think , were 
the <unk> <unk> of my <unk> ." holmes <unk> at the last <unk> . " well ," he said , 
" i say now , as i said then , that a man should keep his little <unk> - <unk> 
<unk> with all the furniture that he is likely to use , and the rest he can put away in 
the <unk> - room of his <unk> , where he can get it if he <unk> it . now , 
for such a case as the one which has been <unk> to us to - night , we need certainly 
to <unk> all our <unk> . kindly hand me down the letter <unk> of the ' <unk> <unk> ' which 
stands upon the <unk> beside you . thank you . now let us <unk> the situation and see what may 
be <unk> from it . in the first <unk> , we may start with a strong <unk> that <unk> <unk> 
had some very strong reason for <unk> <unk> . men at his time of life do not change all their 
habits and exchange <unk> the <unk> <unk> of <unk> for the <unk> life of an english <unk> <unk> . his 
extreme love of <unk> in england <unk> the <unk> that he was in fear of someone or something , so 
we may <unk> as a <unk> <unk> that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from <unk> 
. as to what it was he <unk> , we can only deduce that by <unk> the formidable letters which 
were received by himself and his <unk> . did you <unk> the <unk> of those letters ?" " the first 
was from <unk> , the second from <unk> , and the <unk> from london ." " from <unk> london . 
what do you deduce from that ?" " they are all <unk> . that the <unk> was on <unk> of 
a <unk> ." " excellent . we have already a <unk> . there can be no doubt that the <unk> 
-- the strong <unk> -- is that the <unk> was on <unk> of a <unk> . and now let us 
<unk> another point . in the case of <unk> , seven <unk> <unk> between the <unk> and its <unk> , 
in <unk> it was only some three or four days . does that <unk> anything ?" " a <unk> <unk> 
to <unk> ." " but the letter had also a <unk> <unk> to come ." " then i do not 
see the point ." " there is at least a <unk> that the <unk> in which the man or men 
are is a <unk> - <unk> . it <unk> as if they always send their singular <unk> or <unk> before 
them when <unk> upon their mission . you see how <unk> the <unk> followed the sign when it came from 
<unk> . if they had come from <unk> in a <unk> they would have arrived almost as soon as their 
letter . but , as a matter of <unk> , seven <unk> <unk> . i think that those seven <unk> 
<unk> the <unk> between the <unk> - <unk> which brought the letter and the <unk> <unk> which brought the <unk> 
." " it is <unk> ." " more than that . it is probable . and now you see the 
<unk> <unk> of this new case , and why i <unk> young <unk> to <unk> . the blow has always 
<unk> at the end of the time which it would take the <unk> to <unk> the <unk> . but this 
one comes from london , and therefore we <unk> count upon delay ." " good god !" i cried . 
" what can it mean , this <unk> <unk> ?" " the papers which <unk> carried are obviously of <unk> 
importance to the person or <unk> in the <unk> - <unk> . i think that it is quite clear that 
there must be more than one of them . a single man could not have carried out two <unk> in 
such a way as to <unk> a <unk> ' s <unk> . there must have been several in it , 
and they must have been men of resource and <unk> . their papers they mean to have , be the 
<unk> of them who it may . in this way you see <unk> . <unk> . <unk> . <unk> to 
be the <unk> of an <unk> and becomes the <unk> of a society ." " but of what society ?" 
" have you never --" said sherlock holmes , <unk> forward and <unk> his voice --" have you never heard 
of the <unk> <unk> <unk> ?" " i never have ." holmes turned over the <unk> of the book upon 
his <unk> . " here it is ," said he presently : "' <unk> <unk> <unk> . a name <unk> 
from the <unk> <unk> to the sound produced by <unk> a <unk> . this <unk> secret society was <unk> by 
some <unk> - <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> after the civil <unk> , and it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
in different <unk> of the country , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> 
. its power was <unk> for political purposes , <unk> for the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> 
and driving from the country of those who were <unk> to its <unk> . its <unk> were <unk> <unk> by 
a <unk> sent to the marked man in some <unk> but generally <unk> <unk> -- a <unk> of <unk> - 
<unk> in some <unk> , <unk> <unk> or orange pips in others . on <unk> this the <unk> might either 
<unk> <unk> his former <unk> , or might <unk> from the country . if he <unk> the matter out , 
death would <unk> come upon him , and <unk> in some strange and <unk> manner . so perfect was the 
<unk> of the society , and so <unk> its methods , that there is hardly a case upon <unk> where 
any man <unk> in <unk> it with <unk> , or in which any of its <unk> were <unk> home to 
the <unk> . for some years the <unk> <unk> in <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and 
of the better <unk> of the <unk> in the <unk> . <unk> , in the year <unk> , the <unk> 
rather suddenly <unk> , <unk> there have been <unk> <unk> of the same sort since that date .' " you 
will observe ," said holmes , <unk> down the volume , " that the <unk> breaking up of the society 
was <unk> with the <unk> of <unk> from <unk> with their papers . it may well have been cause and 
<unk> . it is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more <unk> <unk> upon their 
<unk> . you can understand that this <unk> and <unk> may <unk> some of the first men in the <unk> 
, and that there may be many who will not <unk> easy at night until it is recovered ." " 
then the <unk> we have seen --" " is such as we might <unk> . it ran , if i 
remember right , ' sent the pips to a , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> that is , sent the 
society ' s <unk> to them . then there are successive <unk> that a and <unk> <unk> , or left 
the country , and finally that <unk> was <unk> , with , i fear , a <unk> result for <unk> 
. well , i think , doctor , that we may let some light into this dark <unk> , and 
i believe that the only chance young <unk> has in the <unk> is to do what i have told him 
. there is nothing more to be said or to be done to - night , so hand me over 
my <unk> and let us <unk> to <unk> for half an hour the <unk> weather and the still more <unk> 
<unk> of our fellow - men ." it had <unk> in the morning , and the <unk> was <unk> with 
a <unk> <unk> through the <unk> veil which <unk> over the great <unk> . sherlock holmes was already at <unk> 
when i came down . " you will excuse me for not waiting for you ," said he ; " 
i have , i <unk> , a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young <unk> 
' s ." " what steps will you take ?" i asked . " it will very much <unk> upon 
the results of my first <unk> . i may have to go down to <unk> , after all ." " 
you will not go there first ?" " no , i shall <unk> with the <unk> . just ring the 
bell and the maid will bring up your coffee ." as i waited , i <unk> the <unk> <unk> from 
the table and glanced my eye over it . it <unk> upon a <unk> which sent a <unk> to my 
heart . " holmes ," i cried , " you are too late ." " ah !" said he , 
<unk> down his <unk> , " i <unk> as much . how was it done ?" he spoke <unk> , 
but i could see that he was deeply <unk> . " my eye caught the name of <unk> , and 
the <unk> ' tragedy near <unk> <unk> .' here is the account : " between <unk> and ten last night 
police - <unk> <unk> , of the <unk> <unk> , on <unk> near <unk> <unk> , heard a cry for 
help and a <unk> in the <unk> . the night , however , was <unk> dark and <unk> , so 
that , in <unk> of the help of several <unk> - by , it was quite <unk> to <unk> a 
<unk> . the alarm , however , was given , and , by the <unk> of the <unk> - police 
, the <unk> was <unk> recovered . it <unk> to be that of a young gentleman whose name , as 
it appears from an <unk> which was found in his pocket , was john <unk> , and whose <unk> is 
near <unk> . it is <unk> that he may have been <unk> down to catch the last train from <unk> 
station , and that in his <unk> and the extreme <unk> he <unk> his <unk> and walked over the <unk> 
of one of the small <unk> - <unk> for <unk> <unk> . the <unk> <unk> no <unk> of <unk> , 
and there can be no doubt that the <unk> had been the <unk> of an <unk> <unk> , which should 
have the <unk> of <unk> the attention of the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> - <unk> ." 
we sat in silence for some minutes , holmes more <unk> and <unk> than i had ever seen him . 
" that <unk> my <unk> , watson ," he said at last . " it is a <unk> <unk> , 
no doubt , but it <unk> my <unk> . it becomes a <unk> matter with me now , and , 
if god <unk> me <unk> , i shall <unk> my hand upon this gang . that he should come to 
me for help , and that i should send him away to his death <unk> he sprang from his chair 
and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation , with a <unk> upon his <unk> <unk> and a nervous <unk> 
and <unk> of his long <unk> hands . " they must be <unk> <unk> ," he <unk> at last . 
" how could they have <unk> him down there ? the <unk> is not on the <unk> line to the 
station . the <unk> , no doubt , was too crowded , even on such a night , for their 
purpose . well , watson , we shall see who will <unk> in the long run . i am <unk> 
out now !" " to the police ?" " no ; i shall be my own police . when i 
have <unk> the <unk> they may take the <unk> , but not before ." all day i was engaged in 
my <unk> work , and it was late in the evening before i returned to baker street . sherlock holmes 
had not come back yet . it was nearly ten o ' clock before he entered , looking <unk> and 
<unk> . he walked up to the <unk> , and <unk> a <unk> from the <unk> he <unk> it <unk> 
, <unk> it down with a long <unk> of <unk> . " you are <unk> ," i remarked . " 
<unk> . it had escaped my memory . i have had nothing since <unk> ." " nothing ?" " not 
a <unk> . i had no time to think of it ." " and how have you <unk> ?" " 
well ." " you have a <unk> ?" " i have them in the <unk> of my hand . young 
<unk> shall not long remain <unk> . why , watson , let us put their own <unk> <unk> - mark 
upon them . it is well thought of !" " what do you mean ?" he took an orange from 
the <unk> , and <unk> it to <unk> he <unk> out the pips upon the table . of these he 
took five and <unk> them into an <unk> . on the inside of the <unk> he wrote " s . 
<unk> . for <unk> . o ." then he <unk> it and <unk> it to " <unk> <unk> <unk> , 
<unk> ' <unk> <unk> ,' <unk> , <unk> ." " that will <unk> him when he <unk> <unk> ," said 
he , <unk> . " it may give him a <unk> night . he will find it as sure a 
<unk> of his <unk> as <unk> did before him ." " and who is this <unk> <unk> ?" " the 
<unk> of the gang . i shall have the others , but he first ." " how did you <unk> 
it , then ?" he took a large sheet of paper from his pocket , all <unk> with <unk> and 
<unk> . " i have <unk> the whole day ," said he , " over <unk> ' s <unk> and 
<unk> of the old papers , following the future <unk> of every <unk> which <unk> at <unk> in <unk> and 
<unk> in ' <unk> . there were thirty - six <unk> of <unk> <unk> which were <unk> there during those 
months . of these , one , the ' <unk> <unk> ,' <unk> attracted my attention , since , <unk> 
it was <unk> as having <unk> from london , the name is that which is given to one of the 
<unk> of the <unk> ." " <unk> , i think ." " i was not and am not sure which 
; but i knew that the <unk> must have an <unk> <unk> ." " what then ?" " i searched 
the <unk> <unk> , and when i found that the <unk> ' <unk> <unk> ' was there in <unk> , 
' <unk> , my suspicion became a <unk> . i then <unk> as to the <unk> which lay at present 
in the <unk> of london ." " yes ?" " the ' <unk> <unk> ' had arrived here last week 
. i went down to the <unk> <unk> and found that she had been taken down the <unk> by the 
<unk> <unk> this morning , <unk> bound to <unk> . i <unk> to <unk> and <unk> that she had passed 
some time ago , and as the wind is <unk> i have no doubt that she is now past the 
<unk> and not very far from the <unk> of <unk> ." " what will you do , then ?" " 
oh , i have my hand upon him . he and the two <unk> , are as i <unk> , 
the only <unk> - born <unk> in the <unk> . the others are <unk> and <unk> . i know , 
also , that they were all three away from the <unk> last night . i had it from the <unk> 
who has been <unk> their <unk> . by the time that their <unk> - <unk> reaches <unk> the <unk> - 
<unk> will have carried this letter , and the <unk> will have informed the police of <unk> that these three 
gentlemen are <unk> wanted here upon a <unk> of murder ." there is ever a <unk> , however , in 
the best laid of <unk> plans , and the <unk> of john <unk> were never to <unk> the orange pips 
which would show them that another , as <unk> and as resolute as <unk> , was upon their <unk> . 
very long and very <unk> were the <unk> <unk> that year . we waited long for news of the " 
<unk> <unk> " of <unk> , but none ever reached us . we did at last hear that <unk> far 
out in the <unk> a <unk> <unk> - post of a <unk> was seen <unk> in the <unk> of a 
<unk> , with the letters " <unk> . s ." <unk> upon it , and that is all which we 
shall ever know of the <unk> of the " <unk> <unk> ." adventure vi . the man with the twisted 
lip <unk> <unk> , <unk> of the late <unk> <unk> , <unk> . <unk> <unk> principal of the <unk> <unk> 
of st . <unk> ' s , was much <unk> to <unk> . the habit <unk> upon him , as 
i understand , from some <unk> <unk> when he was at <unk> ; for having read <unk> <unk> ' s 
description of his dreams and <unk> , he had <unk> his tobacco with <unk> in an attempt to produce the 
same <unk> . he found , as so many more have done , that the practice is <unk> to <unk> 
than to get <unk> of , and for many years he continued to be a <unk> to the drug , 
an object of <unk> <unk> and pity to his <unk> and <unk> . i can see him now , with 
<unk> , <unk> face , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> - point <unk> , all <unk> in a chair , 
the <unk> and ruin of a noble man . one night -- it was in <unk> , ' <unk> -- 
there came a ring to my bell , about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and <unk> 
at the clock . i sat up in my chair , and my wife laid her <unk> - work down 
in her <unk> and made a little face of <unk> . " a patient !" said she . " you 
' ll have to go out ." i <unk> , for i was <unk> come back from a <unk> day 
. we heard the door open , a few hurried <unk> , and then quick steps upon the <unk> . 
our own door <unk> open , and a lady , <unk> in some dark - coloured <unk> , with a 
black veil , entered the room . " you will excuse my <unk> so late ," she began , and 
then , suddenly <unk> her self - <unk> , she ran forward , threw her arms about my wife ' 
s neck , and <unk> upon her shoulder . " oh , i ' <unk> in such <unk> !" she 
cried ; " i do so want a little help ." " why ," said my wife , <unk> up 
her veil , " it is <unk> <unk> . how you startled me , <unk> ! i had not an 
<unk> who you were when you came in ." " i <unk> ' t know what to do , so 
i came straight to you ." that was always the way . <unk> who were in <unk> came to my 
wife like <unk> to a light - house . " it was very <unk> of you to come . now 
, you must have some <unk> and <unk> , and sit here <unk> and tell us all about it . 
or should you rather that i sent <unk> off to <unk> ?" " oh , no , no ! i 
want the doctor ' s <unk> and help , too . it ' s about <unk> . he has not 
been home for two days . i am so <unk> about him !" it was not the first time that 
she had spoken to us of her husband ' s <unk> , to me as a doctor , to my 
wife as an old friend and <unk> companion . we <unk> and <unk> her by such <unk> as we could 
find . did she know where her husband was ? was it <unk> that we could bring him back to 
her ? it seems that it was . she had the <unk> information that of late he had , when 
the <unk> was on him , made use of an <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> . 
<unk> his <unk> had always been confined to one day , and he had come back , <unk> and <unk> 
, in the evening . but now the <unk> had been upon him eight - and - <unk> hours , 
and he lay there , <unk> among the <unk> of the <unk> , breathing in the <unk> or <unk> off 
the <unk> . there he was to be found , she was sure of it , at the <unk> of 
gold , in upper <unk> lane . but what was she to do ? how could she , a young 
and <unk> woman , make her way into such a <unk> and <unk> her husband out from among the <unk> 
who surrounded him ? there was the case , and of course there was but one way out of it 
. might i not <unk> her to this <unk> ? and then , as a second thought , why should 
she come at all ? i was <unk> <unk> ' s medical <unk> , and as such i had influence 
over him . i could <unk> it better if i were alone . i <unk> her on my word that 
i would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she 
had given me . and so in ten minutes i had left my armchair and <unk> sitting - room behind 
me , and was <unk> <unk> in a hansom on a strange <unk> , as it seemed to me at 
the time , though the future only could show how strange it was to be . but there was no 
great <unk> in the first stage of my adventure . upper <unk> lane is a vile <unk> <unk> behind the 
high <unk> which line the <unk> side of the <unk> to the <unk> of london <unk> . between a <unk> 
- <unk> and a <unk> - <unk> , <unk> by a <unk> flight of steps <unk> down to a black 
<unk> like the mouth of a <unk> , i found the <unk> of which i was in search . <unk> 
my cab to wait , i passed down the steps , <unk> <unk> in the centre by the <unk> <unk> 
of drunken feet ; and by the light of a <unk> <unk> - <unk> above the door i found the 
<unk> and made my way into a long , <unk> room , thick and heavy with the brown <unk> smoke 
, and <unk> with <unk> <unk> , like the <unk> of an <unk> <unk> . through the <unk> one could 
dimly catch a glimpse of <unk> lying in strange <unk> <unk> , <unk> shoulders , <unk> <unk> , heads thrown 
back , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , with here and there a dark , <unk> - <unk> eye turned upon 
the <unk> . out of the black <unk> there <unk> little red <unk> of light , now <unk> , now 
<unk> , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> . the most lay 
<unk> , but some <unk> to <unk> , and others <unk> together in a strange , <unk> , <unk> voice 
, their <unk> coming in <unk> , and then suddenly <unk> off into silence , each mumbling out his own 
<unk> and <unk> little <unk> to the <unk> of his <unk> . at the <unk> end was a small <unk> 
of <unk> <unk> , beside which on a three - <unk> <unk> <unk> there sat a tall , <unk> old 
man , with his <unk> <unk> upon his two fists , and his <unk> upon his <unk> , staring into 
the fire . as i entered , a <unk> <unk> <unk> had hurried up with a <unk> for me and 
a <unk> of the drug , <unk> me to an empty <unk> . " thank you . i have not 
come to stay ," said i . " there is a friend of mine here , mr . <unk> <unk> 
, and i wish to speak with him ." there was a <unk> and an <unk> from my right , 
and peering through the <unk> , i saw <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , staring out at 
me . " my god ! it ' s watson ," said he . he was in a <unk> state 
of <unk> , with every <unk> in a <unk> . " i say , watson , what o ' clock 
is it ?" " nearly <unk> ." " of what day ?" " of <unk> , <unk> <unk> ." " 
good <unk> ! i thought it was <unk> . it is <unk> . what <unk> ' you want to <unk> 
a <unk> for ?" he <unk> his face <unk> his arms and began to <unk> in a high <unk> key 
. " i tell you that it is <unk> , man . your wife has been waiting this two days 
for you . you should be ashamed of yourself !" " so i am . but you ' ve got 
<unk> , watson , for i have only been here a few hours , three <unk> , four <unk> -- 
i <unk> how many . but i ' ll go home with you . i <unk> ' t <unk> <unk> 
-- poor little <unk> . give me your hand ! have you a cab ?" " yes , i have 
one waiting ." " then i shall go in it . but i must <unk> something . find what i 
<unk> , watson . i am all off <unk> . i can do nothing for myself ." i walked down 
the <unk> passage between the double row of <unk> , <unk> my <unk> to keep out the vile , <unk> 
<unk> of the drug , and looking about for the <unk> . as i passed the tall man who sat 
by the <unk> i felt a <unk> <unk> at my <unk> , and a <unk> voice whispered , " walk 
past me , and then look back at me ." the <unk> fell quite <unk> upon my ear . i 
glanced down . they could only have come from the old man at my side , and yet he sat 
now as <unk> as ever , very <unk> , very <unk> , <unk> with <unk> , an <unk> <unk> <unk> 
down from between his <unk> , as though it had dropped in <unk> <unk> from his <unk> . i took 
two steps forward and looked back . it took all my self - <unk> to <unk> me from breaking out 
into a cry of <unk> . he had turned his back so that none could see him but i . 
his form had <unk> out , his <unk> were gone , the dull eyes had <unk> their fire , and 
there , sitting by the fire and <unk> at my surprise , was none other than sherlock holmes . he 
made a <unk> motion to me to <unk> him , and <unk> , as he turned his face half round 
to the company once more , <unk> into a <unk> , <unk> - <unk> <unk> . " holmes !" i 
whispered , " what on <unk> are you doing in this <unk> ?" " as <unk> as you can ," 
he answered ; " i have excellent <unk> . if you would have the great <unk> to get <unk> of 
that <unk> friend of yours i should be <unk> glad to have a little <unk> with you ." " i 
have a cab outside ." " then pray send him home in it . you may safely trust him , 
for he appears to be too limp to get into any <unk> . i should <unk> you also to send 
a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in your <unk> with me . 
if you will wait outside , i shall be with you in five minutes ." it was difficult to refuse 
any of sherlock holmes ' <unk> , for they were always so <unk> <unk> , and put forward with such 
a quiet air of <unk> . i felt , however , that when <unk> was once confined in the cab 
my mission was practically accomplished ; and for the rest , i could not wish anything better than to be 
associated with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the <unk> <unk> of his <unk> . in 
a few minutes i had written my note , paid <unk> ' s <unk> , led him out to the 
cab , and seen him driven through the <unk> . in a very <unk> time a <unk> figure had emerged 
from the <unk> <unk> , and i was walking down the street with sherlock holmes . for two streets he 
<unk> <unk> with a <unk> back and an uncertain <unk> . then , glancing <unk> round , he <unk> himself 
out and <unk> into a <unk> <unk> of <unk> . " i suppose , watson ," said he , " 
that you imagine that i have added <unk> - smoking to cocaine <unk> , and all the other little <unk> 
on which you have <unk> me with your medical <unk> ." " i was certainly <unk> to find you there 
." " but not more so than i to find you ." " i came to find a friend ." 
" and i to find an <unk> ." " an <unk> ?" " yes ; one of my <unk> <unk> 
, or , shall i say , my <unk> <unk> . briefly , watson , i am in the <unk> 
of a very remarkable inquiry , and i have <unk> to find a <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of these 
<unk> , as i have done before now . had i been <unk> in that <unk> my life would not 
have been <unk> an hour ' s <unk> ; for i have <unk> it before now for my own purposes 
, and the <unk> <unk> who runs it has <unk> to have <unk> upon me . there is a <unk> 
- door at the back of that <unk> , near the corner of <unk> ' s <unk> , which could 
tell some strange <unk> of what has passed through it upon the <unk> <unk> ." " what ! you do 
not mean <unk> ?" " <unk> , <unk> , watson . we should be rich men if we had <unk> 
pounds for every poor devil who has been done to death in that <unk> . it is the <unk> murder 
- <unk> on the whole <unk> , and i fear that <unk> st . <unk> has entered it never to 
leave it more . but our <unk> should be here ." he put his two <unk> between his <unk> and 
whistled <unk> -- a signal which was answered by a <unk> <unk> from the <unk> , followed shortly by the 
<unk> of wheels and the <unk> of horses ' hoofs . " now , watson ," said holmes , as 
a tall <unk> - <unk> dashed up through the <unk> , throwing out two <unk> <unk> of <unk> light from 
its side <unk> . " you ' ll come with me , won ' t you ?" " if i 
can be of use ." " oh , a <unk> <unk> is always of use ; and a <unk> still 
more so . my room at the <unk> is a double - <unk> one ." " the <unk> ?" " 
yes ; that is mr . st . <unk> ' s house . i am <unk> there while i conduct 
the inquiry ." " where is it , then ?" " near <unk> , in <unk> . we have a 
seven - <unk> drive before us ." " but i am all in the dark ." " of course you 
are . you ' ll know all about it presently . <unk> up here . all right , john ; 
we shall not need you . here ' s half a crown . look out for me to - morrow 
, about <unk> . give her her head . so long , then !" he <unk> the <unk> with his 
<unk> , and we dashed away through the <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> streets , which widened <unk> , 
until we were <unk> across a broad <unk> <unk> , with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> us . beyond 
lay another dull <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , its silence broken only by the heavy , <unk> <unk> of 
the <unk> , or the <unk> and <unk> of some <unk> <unk> of <unk> . a dull <unk> was <unk> 
slowly across the <unk> , and a <unk> or two <unk> dimly here and there through the <unk> of the 
clouds . holmes drove in silence , with his head sunk upon his <unk> , and the air of a 
man who is lost in thought , while i sat beside him , <unk> to <unk> what this new quest 
might be which seemed to <unk> his powers so <unk> , and yet <unk> to <unk> in upon the <unk> 
of his <unk> . we had driven several <unk> , and were <unk> to get to the <unk> of the 
<unk> of <unk> <unk> , when he <unk> himself , shrugged his shoulders , and lit up his <unk> with 
the air of a man who has <unk> himself that he is <unk> for the best . " you have 
a grand <unk> of silence , watson ," said he . " it <unk> you quite <unk> as a companion 
. ' <unk> my word , it is a great thing for me to have someone to <unk> to , 
for my own <unk> are not over - <unk> . i was wondering what i should say to this dear 
little woman to - night when she <unk> me at the door ." " you <unk> that i know nothing 
about it ." " i shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get 
to <unk> . it seems <unk> simple , and yet , <unk> i can get nothing to go upon . 
there ' s <unk> of <unk> , no doubt , but i can ' t get the end of it 
into my hand . now , i ' ll state the case <unk> and <unk> to you , watson , 
and <unk> you can see a <unk> where all is dark to me ." " <unk> , then ." " 
some years ago -- to be <unk> , in may , <unk> -- there came to <unk> a gentleman , 
<unk> st . <unk> by name , who appeared to have <unk> of money . he took a large villa 
, laid out the <unk> very nicely , and lived generally in good <unk> . by <unk> he made <unk> 
in the neighbourhood , and in <unk> he married the daughter of a <unk> <unk> , by whom he now 
has two <unk> . he had no <unk> , but was interested in several <unk> and went into <unk> as 
a <unk> in the morning , returning by the 5 : <unk> from <unk> street every night . mr . 
st . <unk> is now thirty - seven years of <unk> , is a man of <unk> habits , a 
good husband , a very <unk> <unk> , and a man who is <unk> with all who know him . 
i may <unk> that his whole <unk> at the present moment , as far as we have been able to 
<unk> , <unk> to <unk> pounds <unk> <unk> while he has <unk> pounds standing to his <unk> in the capital 
and <unk> <unk> . there is no reason , therefore , to think that money <unk> have been <unk> upon 
his mind . " last monday mr . <unk> st . <unk> went into <unk> rather <unk> than usual , 
<unk> before he started that he had two important <unk> to <unk> , and that he would bring his little 
boy home a box of <unk> . now , by the <unk> chance , his wife received a <unk> upon 
this same monday , very shortly after his departure , to the <unk> that a small <unk> of <unk> <unk> 
which she had been <unk> was waiting for her at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> company . now , 
if you are well up in your london , you will know that the <unk> of the company is in 
<unk> street , which <unk> out of upper <unk> lane , where you found me to - night . mrs 
. st . <unk> had her <unk> , started for the <unk> , did some <unk> , <unk> to the 
company ' s <unk> , got her packet , and found herself at exactly <unk> : <unk> walking through <unk> 
lane on her way back to the station . have you followed me so far ?" " it is very 
clear ." " if you remember , monday was an <unk> hot day , and mrs . st . <unk> 
walked slowly , glancing about in the hope of <unk> a cab , as she did not like the neighbourhood 
in which she found herself . while she was walking in this way down <unk> lane , she suddenly heard 
an <unk> or cry , and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and , as 
it seemed to her , <unk> to her from a second - floor window . the window was open , 
and she <unk> saw his face , which she <unk> as being <unk> <unk> . he waved his hands <unk> 
to her , and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been 
<unk> back by some <unk> <unk> from behind . one singular point which struck her quick <unk> eye was that 
<unk> he wore some dark coat , such as he had started to <unk> in , he had on neither 
<unk> nor <unk> . " <unk> that something was amiss with him , she rushed down the steps -- for 
the house was none other than the <unk> <unk> in which you found me to - night -- and running 
through the front room she <unk> to <unk> the stairs which led to the first floor . at the <unk> 
of the stairs , however , she <unk> this <unk> <unk> of whom i have spoken , who <unk> her 
back and , <unk> by a <unk> , who <unk> as <unk> there , pushed her out into the street 
. <unk> with the most <unk> doubts and <unk> , she rushed down the lane and , by <unk> good 
- <unk> , <unk> in <unk> street a number of <unk> with an <unk> , all on their way to 
their <unk> . the <unk> and two men <unk> her back , and in <unk> of the continued <unk> of 
the <unk> , they made their way to the room in which mr . st . <unk> had last been 
seen . there was no sign of him there . in <unk> , in the whole of that floor there 
was no one to be found save a <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> , who , it seems , made 
his home there . both he and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that no one else had been in the front 
room during the afternoon . so determined was their <unk> that the <unk> was staggered , and had almost come 
to believe that mrs . st . <unk> had been <unk> when , with a cry , she sprang at 
a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the <unk> from it . out there fell a 
<unk> of <unk> ' s <unk> . it was the <unk> which he had <unk> to bring home . " 
this <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> which the <unk> showed , made the <unk> <unk> that the matter was 
serious . the rooms were carefully examined , and results all <unk> to an <unk> crime . the front room 
was plainly furnished as a sitting - room and led into a small bedroom , which looked out upon the 
back of one of the <unk> . between the <unk> and the bedroom window is a <unk> <unk> , which 
is <unk> at <unk> <unk> but is <unk> at high <unk> with at least four and a half feet of 
<unk> . the bedroom window was a broad one and opened from <unk> . on <unk> <unk> of blood were 
to be seen upon the <unk> , and several scattered <unk> were visible upon the <unk> floor of the bedroom 
. <unk> away behind a <unk> in the front room were all the clothes of mr . <unk> st . 
<unk> , with the <unk> of his coat . his boots , his <unk> , his hat , and his 
watch -- all were there . there were no signs of <unk> upon any of these <unk> , and there 
were no other <unk> of mr . <unk> st . <unk> . out of the window he must apparently have 
gone for no other <unk> could be <unk> , and the ominous <unk> upon the <unk> gave little promise that 
he could save himself by <unk> , for the <unk> was at its very <unk> at the moment of the 
tragedy . " and now as to the <unk> who seemed to be immediately <unk> in the matter . the 
<unk> was known to be a man of the <unk> <unk> , but as , by mrs . st . 
<unk> ' s story , he was known to have been at the <unk> of the <unk> within a very 
few <unk> of her husband ' s appearance at the window , he could hardly have been more than an 
<unk> to the crime . his <unk> was one of absolute <unk> , and he <unk> that he had no 
<unk> as to the doings of <unk> <unk> , his <unk> , and that he could not account in any 
way for the <unk> of the <unk> gentleman ' s clothes . " so much for the <unk> <unk> . 
now for the <unk> <unk> who lives upon the second floor of the <unk> <unk> , and who was certainly 
the last <unk> being whose eyes <unk> upon <unk> st . <unk> . his name is <unk> <unk> , and 
his <unk> face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the <unk> . he is 
a <unk> <unk> , though in order to <unk> the police <unk> he <unk> to a small <unk> in <unk> 
<unk> . some little <unk> down <unk> street , upon the left - hand side , there is , as 
you may have remarked , a small <unk> in the wall . here it is that this creature <unk> his 
daily seat , cross - <unk> with his <unk> <unk> of <unk> on his <unk> , and as he is 
a piteous spectacle a small <unk> of <unk> <unk> into the <unk> leather cap which <unk> upon the pavement beside 
him . i have watched the fellow more than once before ever i thought of making his <unk> acquaintance , 
and i have been <unk> at the <unk> which he has <unk> in a <unk> time . his appearance , 
you see , is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him . a <unk> of orange 
<unk> , a <unk> face <unk> by a <unk> <unk> , which , by its contraction , has turned up 
the <unk> <unk> of his upper lip , a <unk> chin , and a pair of very <unk> dark eyes 
, which present a singular <unk> to the <unk> of his <unk> , all mark him out from <unk> the 
<unk> crowd of <unk> and so , too , does his <unk> , for he is ever <unk> with a 
<unk> to any <unk> of <unk> which may be thrown at him by the <unk> - by . this is 
the man whom we now <unk> to have been the <unk> at the <unk> <unk> , and to have been 
the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest ." " but a <unk> !" said 
i . " what could he have done single - handed against a man in the <unk> of life ?" 
" he is a <unk> in the <unk> that he walks with a limp ; but in other <unk> he 
appears to be a <unk> and well - <unk> man . surely your medical <unk> would tell you , watson 
, that <unk> in one <unk> is often <unk> for by <unk> <unk> in the others ." " pray continue 
your <unk> ." " mrs . st . <unk> had <unk> at the <unk> of the blood upon the window 
, and she was <unk> home in a cab by the police , as her <unk> could be of no 
help to them in their <unk> . <unk> <unk> , who had <unk> of the case , made a very 
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> , but without <unk> anything which threw any light upon the matter . one mistake 
had been made in not <unk> <unk> <unk> , as he was <unk> some few minutes during which he might 
have <unk> with his friend the <unk> , but this <unk> was soon <unk> , and he was seized and 
searched , without anything being found which could <unk> him . there were , it is true , some blood 
- <unk> upon his right <unk> - <unk> , but he <unk> to his ring - <unk> , which had 
been <unk> near the <unk> , and explained that the <unk> came from there , <unk> that he had been 
to the window not long before , and that the <unk> which had been observed there came <unk> from the 
same <unk> . he <unk> <unk> having ever seen mr . <unk> st . <unk> and <unk> that the <unk> 
of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police . as to 
mrs . st . <unk> ' s <unk> that she had <unk> seen her husband at the window , he 
<unk> that she must have been either mad or <unk> . he was <unk> , <unk> <unk> , to the 
police - station , while the <unk> remained upon the <unk> in the hope that the <unk> <unk> might <unk> 
some fresh <unk> . " and it did , though they hardly found upon the mud - <unk> what they 
had <unk> to find . it was <unk> st . <unk> ' s coat , and not <unk> st . 
<unk> , which lay <unk> as the <unk> <unk> . and what do you think they found in the pockets 
?" " i <unk> imagine ." " no , i don ' t think you would guess . every pocket 
<unk> with <unk> and half - <unk> -- <unk> <unk> and <unk> half - <unk> . it was no wonder 
that it had not been <unk> away by the <unk> . but a <unk> <unk> is a different matter . 
there is a fierce <unk> between the <unk> and the house . it seemed likely enough that the <unk> coat 
had remained when the <unk> <unk> had been <unk> away into the <unk> ." " but i understand that all 
the other clothes were found in the room . would the <unk> be dressed in a coat alone ?" " 
no , sir , but the facts might be <unk> <unk> enough . suppose that this man <unk> had <unk> 
<unk> st . <unk> through the window , there is no <unk> eye which could have seen the <unk> . 
what would he do then ? it would of course <unk> <unk> him that he must get <unk> of the 
tell - <unk> <unk> . he would <unk> the coat , then , and be in the <unk> of throwing 
it out , when it would occur to him that it would <unk> and not <unk> . he has little 
time , for he has heard the scuffle <unk> when the wife tried to <unk> her way up , and 
perhaps he has already heard from his <unk> <unk> that the police are <unk> up the street . there is 
not an instant to be lost . he <unk> to some secret <unk> , where he has <unk> the <unk> 
of his <unk> , and he <unk> all the <unk> upon which he can lay his hands into the pockets 
to make sure of the coat ' s <unk> . he <unk> it out , and would have done the 
same with the other <unk> had not he heard the rush of steps <unk> , and only just had time 
to close the window when the police appeared ." " it certainly <unk> <unk> ." " well , we will 
take it as a <unk> <unk> for want of a better . <unk> , as i have told you , 
was <unk> and taken to the station , but it could not be shown that there had ever before been 
anything against him . he had for years been known as a <unk> <unk> , but his life appeared to 
have been a very quiet and <unk> one . there the matter stands at present , and the <unk> which 
have to be <unk> -- what <unk> st . <unk> was doing in the <unk> <unk> , what <unk> to 
him when there , where is he now , and what <unk> <unk> had to do with his <unk> -- 
are all as far from a <unk> as ever . i confess that i <unk> <unk> any case within my 
<unk> which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which <unk> such difficulties ." while sherlock holmes had 
been <unk> this singular <unk> of <unk> , we had been <unk> through the <unk> of the great <unk> until 
the last <unk> houses had been left behind , and we rattled <unk> with a country <unk> upon either side 
of us . just as he finished , however , we drove through two scattered <unk> , where a few 
lights still <unk> in the windows . " we are on the <unk> of <unk> ," said my companion . 
" we have <unk> on three english <unk> in our <unk> drive , <unk> in <unk> , passing over an 
<unk> of <unk> , and <unk> in <unk> . see that light among the <unk> ? that is the <unk> 
, and beside that <unk> <unk> a woman whose <unk> <unk> have already , i have little doubt , caught 
the <unk> of our <unk> ' s feet ." " but why are you not <unk> the case from baker 
street ?" i asked . " because there are many <unk> which must be made out here . mrs . 
st . <unk> has most kindly put two rooms at my <unk> , and you may rest <unk> that she 
will have nothing but a <unk> for my friend and colleague . i <unk> to meet her , watson , 
when i have no news of her husband . here we are . <unk> , there , <unk> !" we 
had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own <unk> . a <unk> - boy 
had run out to the <unk> ' s head , and <unk> down , i followed holmes up the small 
, <unk> <unk> - drive which led to the house . as we <unk> , the door <unk> open , 
and a little <unk> woman stood in the opening , <unk> in some sort of light <unk> <unk> <unk> , 
with a <unk> of <unk> pink <unk> at her neck and <unk> . she stood with her figure outlined against 
the <unk> of light , one hand upon the door , one half - raised in her <unk> , her 
<unk> <unk> <unk> , her head and face <unk> , with <unk> eyes and <unk> <unk> , a standing question 
. " well ?" she cried , " well ?" and then , <unk> that there were two of us 
, she gave a cry of hope which <unk> into a <unk> as she saw that my companion <unk> his 
head and shrugged his shoulders . " no good news ?" " none ." " no bad ?" " no 
." " thank god for that . but come in . you must be <unk> , for you have had 
a long day ." " this is my friend , dr . watson . he has been of most <unk> 
use to me in several of my cases , and a lucky chance has made it <unk> for me to 
bring him out and <unk> him with this investigation ." " i am delighted to see you ," said she 
, <unk> my hand <unk> . " you will , i am sure , <unk> anything that may be <unk> 
in our arrangements , when you <unk> the blow which has come so suddenly upon us ." " my dear 
<unk> ," said i , " i am an old <unk> , and if i were not i can very 
well see that no <unk> is <unk> . if i can be of any <unk> , either to you or 
to my friend here , i shall be indeed <unk> ." " now , mr . sherlock holmes ," said 
the lady as we entered a well - lit <unk> - room , upon the table of which a cold 
<unk> had been laid out , " i should very much like to <unk> you one or two <unk> <unk> 
, to which i <unk> that you will give a <unk> <unk> ." " certainly , <unk> ." " do 
not <unk> about my <unk> . i am not <unk> , nor given to <unk> . i <unk> wish to 
hear your <unk> , <unk> <unk> ." " upon what point ?" " in your heart of <unk> , do 
you think that <unk> is <unk> ?" sherlock holmes seemed to be <unk> by the question . " <unk> , 
now !" she repeated , standing upon the <unk> and looking <unk> down at him as he <unk> back in 
a <unk> - chair . " <unk> , then , <unk> , i do not ." " you think that 
he is dead ?" " i do ." " <unk> ?" " i don ' t say that . perhaps 
." " and on what day did he meet his death ?" " on monday ." " then perhaps , 
mr . holmes , you will be good enough to explain how it is that i have received a letter 
from him to - day ." sherlock holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been <unk> . 
" what !" he <unk> . " yes , to - day ." she stood <unk> , <unk> up a 
little <unk> of paper in the air . " may i see it ?" " certainly ." he <unk> it 
from her in his <unk> , and <unk> it out upon the table he drew over the <unk> and examined 
it <unk> . i had left my chair and was <unk> at it over his shoulder . the <unk> was 
a very <unk> one and was <unk> with the <unk> <unk> and with the date of that very day , 
or rather of the day before , for it was <unk> after midnight . " <unk> writing ," murmured holmes 
. " surely this is not your husband ' s writing , <unk> ." " no , but the <unk> 
is ." " i <unk> also that <unk> <unk> the <unk> had to go and <unk> as to the address 
." " how can you tell that ?" " the name , you see , is in perfectly black <unk> 
, which has <unk> itself . the rest is of the <unk> <unk> , which <unk> that <unk> - paper 
has been <unk> . if it had been written straight off , and then <unk> , none would be of 
a deep black <unk> . this man has written the name , and there has then been a <unk> before 
he wrote the address , which can only mean that he was not familiar with it . it is , 
of course , a trifle , but there is nothing so important as <unk> . let us now see the 
letter . ha ! there has been an <unk> here !" " yes , there was a ring . his 
<unk> - ring ." " and you are sure that this is your husband ' s hand ?" " one 
of his hands ." " one ?" " his hand when he wrote hurriedly . it is very <unk> his 
usual writing , and yet i know it well ." "' <unk> do not be <unk> . all will come 
well . there is a <unk> <unk> which it may take some little time to <unk> . wait in <unk> 
<unk> <unk> .' written in <unk> upon the <unk> - <unk> of a book , <unk> size , no <unk> 
- mark . hum ! posted to - day in <unk> by a man with a <unk> thumb . ha 
! and the <unk> has been <unk> , if i am not very much in <unk> , by a person 
who had been <unk> tobacco . and you have no doubt that it is your husband ' s hand , 
<unk> ?" " none . <unk> wrote those <unk> ." " and they were posted to - day at <unk> 
. well , mrs . st . <unk> , the clouds <unk> , though i should not <unk> to say 
that the <unk> is over ." " but he must be <unk> , mr . holmes ." " <unk> this 
is a <unk> forgery to put us on the <unk> scent . the ring , after all , <unk> nothing 
. it may have been taken from him ." " no , no ; it is , it is his 
very own writing !" " very well . it may , however , have been written on monday and only 
posted to - day ." " that is <unk> ." " if so , much may have <unk> between ." 
" oh , you must not <unk> me , mr . holmes . i know that all is well with 
him . there is so keen a sympathy between us that i should know if evil came upon him . 
on the very day that i saw him last he <unk> himself in the bedroom , and yet i in 
the <unk> - room rushed <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> that something had <unk> . do you think that 
i would <unk> to such a trifle and yet be <unk> of his death ?" " i have seen too 
much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more <unk> than the conclusion of an <unk> 
reasoner . and in this letter you certainly have a very strong <unk> of <unk> to <unk> your view . 
but if your husband is <unk> and able to <unk> letters , why should he remain away from you ?" 
" i <unk> imagine . it is <unk> ." " and on monday he made no <unk> before <unk> you 
?" " no ." " and you were <unk> to see him in <unk> lane ?" " very much so 
." " was the window open ?" " yes ." " then he might have called to you ?" " 
he might ." " he only , as i understand , gave an <unk> cry ?" " yes ." " 
a call for help , you thought ?" " yes . he waved his hands ." " but it might 
have been a cry of surprise . <unk> at the unexpected <unk> of you might cause him to throw up 
his hands ?" " it is <unk> ." " and you thought he was pulled back ?" " he disappeared 
so suddenly ." " he might have <unk> back . you did not see anyone else in the room ?" 
" no , but this <unk> man <unk> to having been there , and the <unk> was at the <unk> 
of the stairs ." " quite so . your husband , as far as you could see , had his 
ordinary clothes on ?" " but without his <unk> or tie . i <unk> saw his <unk> <unk> ." " 
had he ever spoken of <unk> lane ?" " never ." " had he ever showed any signs of having 
taken <unk> ?" " never ." " thank you , mrs . st . <unk> . those are the principal 
<unk> about which i wished to be absolutely clear . we shall now have a little <unk> and then <unk> 
, for we may have a very busy day to - morrow ." a large and comfortable double - <unk> 
room had been placed at our <unk> , and i was <unk> between the <unk> , for i was <unk> 
after my night of adventure . sherlock holmes was a man , however , who , when he had an 
<unk> problem upon his mind , would go for days , and even for a week , without rest , 
<unk> it over , <unk> his facts , looking at it from every point of view until he had either 
<unk> it or <unk> himself that his data were <unk> . it was soon <unk> to me that he was 
now <unk> for an all - night sitting . he took off his coat and <unk> , put on a 
large blue <unk> - <unk> , and then <unk> about the room <unk> <unk> from his <unk> and <unk> from 
the sofa and <unk> . with these he <unk> a sort of <unk> <unk> , upon which he <unk> himself 
cross - <unk> , with an <unk> of shag tobacco and a box of <unk> laid out in front of 
him . in the <unk> light of the <unk> i saw him sitting there , an old <unk> <unk> between 
his <unk> , his eyes <unk> <unk> upon the corner of the <unk> , the blue smoke <unk> up from 
him , <unk> , <unk> , with the light <unk> upon his strong - <unk> aquiline features . so he 
sat as i dropped off to <unk> , and so he sat when a <unk> <unk> caused me to <unk> 
up , and i found the <unk> <unk> <unk> into the <unk> . the <unk> was still between his <unk> 
, the smoke still curled <unk> , and the room was <unk> of a <unk> tobacco <unk> , but nothing 
remained of the <unk> of shag which i had seen upon the <unk> night . " <unk> , watson ?" 
he asked . " yes ." " <unk> for a morning drive ?" " certainly ." " then dress . 
no one is <unk> yet , but i know where the <unk> - boy <unk> , and we shall soon 
have the <unk> out ." he chuckled to himself as he spoke , his eyes <unk> , and he seemed 
a different man to the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> night . as i dressed i glanced at my watch 
. it was no wonder that no one was <unk> . it was twenty - five minutes past four . 
i had hardly finished when holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the <unk> . " 
i want to <unk> a little <unk> of mine ," said he , <unk> on his boots . " i 
think , watson , that you are now standing in the <unk> of one of the most absolute <unk> in 
europe . i <unk> to be <unk> from here to charing cross . but i think i have the key 
of the <unk> now ." " and where is it ?" i asked , <unk> . " in the <unk> 
," he answered . " oh , yes , i am not <unk> ," he continued , <unk> my look 
of <unk> . " i have just been there , and i have taken it out , and i have 
got it in this <unk> bag . come on , my boy , and we shall see whether it will 
not <unk> the lock ." we made our way <unk> as quietly as <unk> , and out into the <unk> 
morning <unk> . in the road stood our <unk> and <unk> , with the half - <unk> <unk> - boy 
waiting at the head . we both sprang in , and away we dashed down the london road . a 
few country <unk> were <unk> , <unk> in <unk> to the <unk> , but the <unk> of <unk> on either 
side were as <unk> and <unk> as some <unk> in a <unk> . " it has been in some <unk> 
a singular case ," said holmes , <unk> the <unk> on into a <unk> . " i confess that i 
have been as blind as a <unk> , but it is better to <unk> <unk> late than never to <unk> 
it at all ." in <unk> the <unk> <unk> were just <unk> to look <unk> from their windows as we 
drove through the streets of the <unk> side . passing down the <unk> <unk> road we <unk> over the <unk> 
, and dashing up <unk> street <unk> <unk> to the right and found ourselves in <unk> street . sherlock holmes 
was well known to the <unk> , and the two <unk> at the door <unk> him . one of them 
<unk> the <unk> ' s head while the other led us in . " who is on <unk> ?" asked 
holmes . " <unk> <unk> , sir ." " ah , <unk> , how are you ?" a tall , 
<unk> official had come down the <unk> - <unk> passage , in a <unk> cap and <unk> <unk> . " 
i wish to have a quiet word with you , <unk> ." " certainly , mr . holmes . step 
into my room here ." it was a small , <unk> - like room , with a <unk> <unk> upon 
the table , and a <unk> <unk> from the wall . the <unk> sat down at his <unk> . " 
what can i do for you , mr . holmes ?" " i called about that <unk> , <unk> -- 
the one who was <unk> with being <unk> in the <unk> of mr . <unk> st . <unk> , of 
<unk> ." " yes . he was brought up and <unk> for <unk> <unk> ." " so i heard . 
you have him here ?" " in the <unk> ." " is he quiet ?" " oh , he gives 
no <unk> . but he is a <unk> <unk> ." " <unk> ?" " yes , it is all we 
can do to make him <unk> his hands , and his face is as black as a <unk> ' s 
. well , when once his case has been <unk> , he will have a <unk> <unk> <unk> ; and 
i think , if you saw him , you would <unk> with me that he <unk> it ." " i 
should like to see him very much ." " would you ? that is easily done . come this way 
. you can leave your bag ." " no , i think that i ' ll take it ." " 
very good . come this way , if you please ." he led us down a passage , opened a 
<unk> door , passed down a <unk> <unk> , and brought us to a <unk> <unk> with a line of 
<unk> on each side . " the <unk> on the right is his ," said the <unk> . " here 
it is !" he quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through . 
" he is <unk> ," said he . " you can see him very well ." we both put our 
eyes to the grating . the <unk> lay with his face towards us , in a very deep <unk> , 
breathing slowly and <unk> . he was a <unk> - <unk> man , <unk> <unk> as became his <unk> , 
with a coloured <unk> <unk> through the <unk> in his <unk> coat . he was , as the <unk> had 
said , <unk> <unk> , but the <unk> which <unk> his face could not conceal its <unk> <unk> . a 
broad <unk> from an old <unk> ran right across it from eye to chin , and by its contraction had 
turned up one side of the upper lip , so that three <unk> were <unk> in a <unk> <unk> . 
a <unk> of very <unk> red <unk> <unk> <unk> over his eyes and forehead . " he ' s a 
<unk> , <unk> ' t he ?" said the <unk> . " he certainly <unk> a <unk> ," remarked holmes 
. " i had an <unk> that he might , and i took the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> with 
me ." he opened the <unk> bag as he spoke , and took out , to my <unk> , a 
very large <unk> - <unk> . " he ! he ! you are a funny one ," chuckled the <unk> 
. " now , if you will have the great <unk> to open that door very quietly , we will 
soon make him <unk> a much more respectable figure ." " well , i don ' t know why not 
," said the <unk> . " he <unk> ' t look a <unk> to the <unk> street <unk> , does 
he ?" he <unk> his key into the lock , and we all very quietly entered the <unk> . the 
<unk> half turned , and then <unk> down once more into a deep <unk> . holmes <unk> to the <unk> 
- <unk> , <unk> his <unk> , and then rubbed it twice <unk> across and down the <unk> ' s 
face . " let me introduce you ," he shouted , " to mr . <unk> st . <unk> , 
of <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> ." never in my life have i seen such a <unk> . 
the man ' s face <unk> off under the <unk> like the <unk> from a <unk> . gone was the 
<unk> brown <unk> ! gone , too , was the <unk> <unk> which had <unk> it across , and the 
twisted lip which had given the <unk> sneer to the face ! a <unk> brought away the <unk> red <unk> 
, and there , sitting up in his <unk> , was a <unk> , <unk> - faced , <unk> - 
looking man , black - <unk> and <unk> - <unk> , rubbing his eyes and staring about him with <unk> 
<unk> . then suddenly <unk> the <unk> , he broke into a <unk> and threw himself down with his face 
to the <unk> . " great <unk> !" cried the <unk> , " it is , indeed , the <unk> 
man . i know him from the photograph ." the <unk> turned with the <unk> air of a man who 
<unk> himself to his <unk> . " be it so ," said he . " and pray what am i 
<unk> with ?" " with making away with mr . <unk> st <unk> oh , come , you can ' 
t be <unk> with that <unk> they make a case of <unk> <unk> of it ," said the <unk> with 
a <unk> . " well , i have been twenty - seven years in the <unk> , but this really 
<unk> the <unk> ." " if i am mr . <unk> st . <unk> , then it is <unk> that 
no crime has been committed , and that , therefore , i am <unk> <unk> ." " no crime , 
but a very great <unk> has been committed ," said holmes . " you would have done better to have 
trusted your wife ." " it was not the wife ; it was the <unk> ," <unk> the <unk> . 
" god help me , i would not have them ashamed of their <unk> . my god ! what an 
<unk> ! what can i do ?" sherlock holmes sat down beside him on the couch and <unk> him kindly 
on the shoulder . " if you leave it to a <unk> of law to clear the matter up ," 
said he , " of course you can hardly <unk> <unk> . on the other hand , if you <unk> 
the police <unk> that there is no <unk> case against you , i do not know that there is any 
reason that the details should find their way into the papers . <unk> <unk> would , i am sure , 
make notes upon anything which you might tell us and <unk> it to the <unk> <unk> . the case would 
then never go into <unk> at all ." " god <unk> you !" cried the <unk> <unk> . " i 
would have <unk> <unk> , <unk> , even <unk> , rather than have left my <unk> secret as a family 
<unk> to my <unk> . " you are the first who have ever heard my story . my <unk> was 
a <unk> in <unk> , where i received an excellent <unk> . i travelled in my youth , took to 
the stage , and finally became a <unk> on an evening paper in london . one day my <unk> wished 
to have a <unk> of <unk> upon <unk> in the <unk> , and i <unk> to <unk> them . there 
was the point from which all my adventures started . it was only by <unk> <unk> as an <unk> that 
i could get the facts upon which to <unk> my <unk> . when an actor i had , of course 
, <unk> all the <unk> of making up , and had been <unk> in the <unk> - room for my 
<unk> . i took advantage now of my <unk> . i <unk> my face , and to make myself as 
<unk> as <unk> i made a good <unk> and <unk> one side of my lip in a twist by the 
<unk> of a small <unk> of <unk> - coloured <unk> . then with a red head of <unk> , and 
an <unk> dress , i took my station in the business part of the <unk> , <unk> as a <unk> 
- <unk> but really as a <unk> . for seven hours i <unk> my <unk> , and when i returned 
home in the evening i found to my surprise that i had received no less than <unk> . <unk> . 
" i wrote my <unk> and thought little more of the matter until , some time later , i <unk> 
a <unk> for a friend and had a <unk> <unk> upon me for <unk> pounds . i was at my 
<unk> ' s end where to get the money , but a <unk> <unk> came to me . i <unk> 
a <unk> ' s grace from the <unk> , asked for a <unk> from my <unk> , and <unk> the 
time in <unk> in the <unk> under my <unk> . in ten days i had the money and had paid 
the <unk> . " well , you can imagine how hard it was to <unk> down to <unk> work at 
<unk> pounds a week when i knew that i could <unk> as much in a day by <unk> my face 
with a little paint , <unk> my cap on the ground , and sitting still . it was a long 
<unk> between my <unk> and the money , but the <unk> won at last , and i threw up <unk> 
and sat day after day in the corner which i had first <unk> , <unk> pity by my <unk> face 
and <unk> my pockets with <unk> . only one man knew my secret . he was the <unk> of a 
<unk> <unk> in which i <unk> to lodge in <unk> lane , where i could every morning <unk> as a 
<unk> <unk> and in the <unk> <unk> myself into a well - dressed man about <unk> . this fellow , 
a <unk> , was well paid by me for his rooms , so that i knew that my secret was 
safe in his <unk> . " well , very soon i found that i was <unk> <unk> <unk> of money 
. i do not mean that any <unk> in the streets of london could <unk> <unk> pounds a year -- 
which is less than my <unk> <unk> -- but i had <unk> advantages in my power of making up , 
and also in a <unk> of <unk> , which <unk> by practice and made me quite a <unk> character in 
the <unk> . all day a <unk> of <unk> , <unk> by silver , <unk> in upon me , and 
it was a very bad day in which i failed to take <unk> pounds . " as i <unk> <unk> 
i <unk> more <unk> , took a house in the country , and <unk> married , without anyone having a 
suspicion as to my <unk> <unk> . my dear wife knew that i had business in the <unk> . she 
little knew what . " last monday i had finished for the day and was <unk> in my room above 
the <unk> <unk> when i looked out of my window and saw , to my <unk> and <unk> , that 
my wife was standing in the street , with her eyes <unk> <unk> upon me . i gave a cry 
of surprise , threw up my arms to <unk> my face , and , rushing to my confidant , the 
<unk> , <unk> him to <unk> anyone from coming up to me . i heard her voice <unk> , but 
i knew that she could not <unk> . swiftly i threw off my clothes , pulled on those of a 
<unk> , and put on my <unk> and <unk> . even a wife ' s eyes could not <unk> so 
complete a <unk> . but then it <unk> to me that there might be a search in the room , 
and that the clothes might <unk> me . i threw open the window , <unk> by my <unk> a small 
<unk> which i had <unk> upon myself in the bedroom that morning . then i seized my coat , which 
was <unk> by the <unk> which i had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which i carried 
my <unk> . i hurled it out of the window , and it disappeared into the <unk> . the other 
clothes would have followed , but at that moment there was a rush of <unk> up the <unk> , and 
a few minutes after i found , rather , i confess , to my <unk> , that instead of being 
<unk> as mr . <unk> st . <unk> , i was <unk> as his <unk> . " i do not 
know that there is anything else for me to explain . i was determined to preserve my <unk> as long 
as <unk> , and hence my <unk> for a <unk> face . <unk> that my wife would be <unk> <unk> 
, i <unk> off my ring and <unk> it to the <unk> at a moment when no <unk> was watching 
me , together with a hurried <unk> , <unk> her that she had no cause to fear ." " that 
note only reached her yesterday ," said holmes . " good god ! what a week she must have <unk> 
!" " the police have watched this <unk> ," said <unk> <unk> , " and i can quite understand that 
he might find it difficult to post a letter <unk> . probably he handed it to some <unk> <unk> of 
his , who <unk> all about it for some days ." " that was it ," said holmes , <unk> 
<unk> ; " i have no doubt of it . but have you never been <unk> for <unk> ?" " 
many times ; but what was a fine to me ?" " it must <unk> here , however ," said 
<unk> . " if the police are to <unk> this thing up , there must be no more of <unk> 
<unk> ." " i have <unk> it by the most <unk> <unk> which a man can take ." " in 
that case i think that it is probable that no <unk> steps may be taken . but if you are 
found again , then all must come out . i am sure , mr . holmes , that we are 
very much indebted to you for having <unk> the matter up . i wish i knew how you reach your 
results ." " i reached this one ," said my friend , " by sitting upon five <unk> and <unk> 
an <unk> of shag . i think , watson , that if we drive to baker street we shall just 
be in time for <unk> ." vii . the adventure of the blue carbuncle i had called upon my friend 
sherlock holmes upon the second morning after <unk> , with the intention of <unk> him the <unk> of the <unk> 
. he was lounging upon the sofa in a <unk> <unk> - <unk> , a <unk> - <unk> within his 
reach upon the right , and a <unk> of <unk> morning papers , evidently <unk> <unk> , near at hand 
. beside the couch was a <unk> chair , and on the <unk> of the back <unk> a very <unk> 
and disreputable hard - felt hat , much the <unk> for wear , and <unk> in several <unk> . a 
<unk> and a <unk> lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been <unk> in this 
manner for the purpose of <unk> . " you are engaged ," said i ; " perhaps i <unk> you 
." " not at all . i am glad to have a friend with whom i can discuss my results 
. the matter is a perfectly <unk> one <unk> he <unk> his thumb in the direction of the old hat 
--" but there are <unk> in <unk> with it which are not entirely <unk> of interest and even of <unk> 
." i <unk> myself in his armchair and <unk> my hands before his <unk> fire , for a sharp <unk> 
had <unk> in , and the windows were thick with the <unk> <unk> . " i suppose ," i remarked 
, " that , <unk> as it <unk> , this thing has some <unk> story <unk> on to it -- 
that it is the <unk> which will <unk> you in the <unk> of some mystery and the <unk> of some 
crime ." " no , no . no crime ," said sherlock holmes , laughing . " only one of 
those <unk> little incidents which will <unk> when you have four <unk> <unk> <unk> all <unk> each other within the 
<unk> of a few <unk> <unk> . <unk> the action and <unk> of so <unk> a <unk> of <unk> , 
every <unk> <unk> of <unk> may be expected to take <unk> , and many a little problem will be <unk> 
which may be <unk> and <unk> without being <unk> . we have already had <unk> of such ." " so 
much so ," i remarked , " that of the last six cases which i have added to my notes 
, three have been entirely <unk> of any legal crime ." " precisely . you <unk> to my attempt to 
<unk> the irene adler papers , to the singular case of miss mary <unk> , and to the adventure of 
the man with the twisted lip . well , i have no doubt that this small matter will fall into 
the same <unk> <unk> . you know <unk> , the <unk> ?" " yes ." " it is to him 
that this <unk> <unk> ." " it is his hat ." " no , no , he found it . 
its <unk> is unknown . i <unk> that you will look upon it not as a <unk> <unk> but as 
an <unk> problem . and , first , as to how it came here . it arrived upon <unk> morning 
, in company with a good <unk> <unk> , which is , i have no doubt , <unk> at this 
moment in front of <unk> ' s fire . the facts are these : about four o ' clock on 
<unk> morning , <unk> , who , as you know , is a very <unk> fellow , was returning from 
some small <unk> and was making his way <unk> down <unk> <unk> road . in front of him he saw 
, in the <unk> , a <unk> man , walking with a <unk> <unk> , and <unk> a white <unk> 
<unk> over his shoulder . as he reached the corner of <unk> street , a row broke out between this 
<unk> and a little knot of <unk> . one of the latter <unk> off the man ' s hat , 
on which he raised his <unk> to <unk> himself and , <unk> it over his head , <unk> the <unk> 
window behind him . <unk> had rushed forward to protect the <unk> from his <unk> ; but the man , 
<unk> at having broken the window , and <unk> an official - looking person in <unk> rushing towards him , 
dropped his <unk> , took to his heels , and vanished <unk> the <unk> of small streets which lie at 
the back of <unk> <unk> road . the <unk> had also <unk> at the appearance of <unk> , so that 
he was left in <unk> of the field of <unk> , and also of the <unk> of <unk> in the 
<unk> of this <unk> hat and a most <unk> <unk> <unk> ." " which surely he <unk> to their <unk> 
?" " my dear fellow , there <unk> the problem . it is true that ' for mrs . <unk> 
baker ' was <unk> upon a small <unk> which was <unk> to the <unk> ' s left <unk> , and 
it is also true that the <unk> ' <unk> . <unk> .' are <unk> upon the <unk> of this hat 
, but as there are some <unk> of <unk> , and some hundreds of <unk> <unk> in this <unk> of 
<unk> , it is not easy to <unk> lost <unk> to any one of them ." " what , then 
, did <unk> do ?" " he brought round both hat and <unk> to me on <unk> morning , <unk> 
that even the <unk> problems are of interest to me . the <unk> we <unk> until this morning , when 
there were signs that , in <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , it would be well that it should be 
<unk> without <unk> delay . its <unk> has carried it off , therefore , to <unk> the <unk> <unk> of 
a <unk> , while i continue to <unk> the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his <unk> dinner ." 
" did he not <unk> ?" " no ." " then , what <unk> could you have as to his 
identity ?" " only as much as we can deduce ." " from his hat ?" " precisely ." " 
but you are <unk> . what can you <unk> from this old <unk> felt ?" " here is my <unk> 
. you know my methods . what can you <unk> yourself as to the <unk> of the man who has 
<unk> this <unk> ?" i took the <unk> object in my hands and turned it over rather <unk> . it 
was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round <unk> , hard and much the <unk> for wear . 
the <unk> had been of red silk , but was a good deal <unk> . there was no maker ' 
s name ; but , as holmes had remarked , the <unk> " <unk> . <unk> ." were <unk> upon 
one side . it was <unk> in the <unk> for a hat - <unk> , but the <unk> was <unk> 
. for the rest , it was <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> in several <unk> , <unk> there 
seemed to have been some attempt to <unk> the <unk> <unk> by <unk> them with <unk> . " i can 
see nothing ," said i , <unk> it back to my friend . " on the contrary , watson , 
you can see <unk> . you fail , however , to reason from what you see . you are too 
<unk> in drawing your <unk> ." " then , pray tell me what it is that you can <unk> from 
this hat ?" he <unk> it up and <unk> at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was <unk> of 
him . " it is perhaps less suggestive than it might have been ," he remarked , " and yet 
there are a few <unk> which are very <unk> , and a few others which <unk> at least a strong 
<unk> of <unk> . that the man was <unk> <unk> is of course <unk> upon the face of it , 
and also that he was <unk> well - to - do within the last three years , <unk> he has 
now <unk> upon evil days . he had <unk> , but has less now than formerly , <unk> to a 
<unk> <unk> , which , when taken with the <unk> of his <unk> , seems to <unk> some evil influence 
, probably <unk> , at work upon him . this may account also for the <unk> <unk> that his wife 
has ceased to love him ." " my dear holmes !" " he has , however , <unk> some <unk> 
of self - <unk> ," he continued , <unk> my <unk> . " he is a man who <unk> a 
<unk> life , goes out little , is out of <unk> entirely , is <unk> - <unk> , has <unk> 
<unk> which he has had <unk> within the last few days , and which he <unk> with <unk> - <unk> 
. these are the more <unk> facts which are to be <unk> from his hat . also , by the 
way , that it is <unk> <unk> that he has <unk> laid on in his house ." " you are 
certainly <unk> , holmes ." " not in the least . is it <unk> that even now , when i 
give you these results , you are <unk> to see how they are <unk> ?" " i have no doubt 
that i am very <unk> , but i must confess that i am <unk> to follow you . for example 
, how did you deduce that this man was <unk> ?" for <unk> holmes clapped the hat upon his head 
. it came right over the forehead and <unk> upon the <unk> of his <unk> . " it is a 
question of <unk> <unk> ," said he ; " a man with so large a <unk> must have something in 
it ." " the <unk> of his <unk> , then ?" " this hat is three years old . these 
<unk> <unk> curled at the <unk> came in then . it is a hat of the very best <unk> . 
look at the band of <unk> silk and the excellent <unk> . if this man could <unk> to <unk> so 
<unk> a hat three years ago , and has had no hat since , then he has <unk> gone down 
in the world ." " well , that is clear enough , certainly . but how about the <unk> and 
the <unk> <unk> ?" sherlock holmes laughed . " here is the <unk> ," said he putting his <unk> upon 
the little <unk> and <unk> of the hat - <unk> . " they are never <unk> upon <unk> . if 
this man <unk> one , it is a sign of a certain <unk> of <unk> , since he went out 
of his way to take this precaution against the wind . but since we see that he has broken the 
<unk> and has not <unk> to <unk> it , it is <unk> that he has less <unk> now than formerly 
, which is a <unk> <unk> of a <unk> nature . on the other hand , he has <unk> to 
conceal some of these <unk> upon the felt by <unk> them with <unk> , which is a sign that he 
has not entirely lost his self - <unk> ." " your reasoning is certainly <unk> ." " the <unk> <unk> 
, that he is <unk> - <unk> , that his <unk> is <unk> , that it has been <unk> <unk>

lower part of the <unk> . the <unk> <unk> a large number of <unk> - <unk> , <unk> <unk> by 
the scissors of the <unk> . they all <unk> to be <unk> , and there is a <unk> <unk> of 
<unk> - <unk> . this <unk> , you will observe , is not the <unk> , <unk> <unk> of the 
street but the <unk> brown <unk> of the house , showing that it has been <unk> up <unk> most of 
the time , while the <unk> of <unk> upon the inside are <unk> <unk> that the <unk> <unk> very freely 
, and could therefore , hardly be in the best of <unk> ." " but his wife -- you said 
that she had ceased to love him ." " this hat has not been brushed for <unk> . when i 
see you , my dear watson , with a week ' s <unk> of <unk> upon your hat , and 
when your wife <unk> you to go out in such a state , i shall fear that you also have 
been <unk> enough to lose your wife ' s <unk> ." " but he might be a bachelor ." " 
<unk> , he was <unk> home the <unk> as a peace - <unk> to his wife . remember the <unk> 
upon the <unk> ' s <unk> ." " you have an <unk> to <unk> . but how on <unk> do 
you deduce that the <unk> is not laid on in his house ?" " one <unk> <unk> , or even 
two , might come by chance ; but when i see no less than five , i think that there 
can be little doubt that the <unk> must be brought into <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk> -- walks <unk> at 
night probably with his hat in one hand and a <unk> <unk> in the other . <unk> , he never 
got <unk> - <unk> from a <unk> - <unk> . are you <unk> ?" " well , it is very 
<unk> ," said i , laughing ; " but since , as you said just now , there has been 
no crime committed , and no <unk> done save the <unk> of a <unk> , all this seems to be 
rather a <unk> of energy ." sherlock holmes had opened his mouth to <unk> , when the door <unk> open 
, and <unk> , the <unk> , rushed into the <unk> with flushed <unk> and the face of a man 
who is <unk> with <unk> . " the <unk> , mr . holmes ! the <unk> , sir !" he 
<unk> . " <unk> ? what of it , then ? has it returned to life and <unk> off through 
the <unk> window ?" holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a <unk> view of the man ' 
s <unk> face . " see here , sir ! see what my wife found in its <unk> !" he 
<unk> out his hand and <unk> upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly <unk> blue <unk> , rather <unk> 
than a <unk> in size , but of such <unk> and <unk> that it <unk> like an <unk> point in 
the dark <unk> of his hand . sherlock holmes sat up with a <unk> . " by <unk> , <unk> 
!" said he , " this is <unk> <unk> indeed . i suppose you know what you have got ?" 
" a <unk> , sir ? a precious <unk> . it cuts into glass as though it were <unk> ." 
" it ' s more than a precious <unk> . it is the precious <unk> ." " not the <unk> 
of <unk> ' s blue carbuncle !" i <unk> . " precisely so . i <unk> to know its size 
and <unk> , <unk> that i have read the <unk> about it in the times every day lately . it 
is absolutely <unk> , and its <unk> can only be <unk> , but the reward <unk> of <unk> pounds is 
certainly not within a twentieth part of the <unk> <unk> ." " a <unk> pounds ! great <unk> of <unk> 
!" the <unk> <unk> down into a chair and <unk> from one to the other of us . " that 
is the reward , and i have reason to know that there are <unk> <unk> in the <unk> which would 
<unk> the <unk> to part with half her <unk> if she could but <unk> the <unk> ." " it was 
lost , if i remember <unk> , at the <unk> <unk> ," i remarked . " precisely so , on 
<unk> <unk> , just five days ago . john <unk> , a plumber , was <unk> of having <unk> it 
from the lady ' s jewel - case . the <unk> against him was so strong that the case has 
been <unk> to the <unk> . i have some account of the matter here , i believe ." he <unk> 
<unk> his <unk> , glancing over the <unk> , until at last he <unk> one out , <unk> it over 
, and read the following <unk> : " <unk> <unk> jewel <unk> . john <unk> , <unk> , plumber , 
was brought up upon the <unk> of having upon the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the jewel - case of 
the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> <unk> known as the blue carbuncle . <unk> <unk> , upper - <unk> at 
the <unk> , gave his <unk> to the <unk> that he had shown <unk> up to the <unk> - room 
of the <unk> of <unk> upon the day of the <unk> in order that he might <unk> the second <unk> 
of the <unk> , which was <unk> . he had remained with <unk> some little time , but had finally 
been called away . on returning , he found that <unk> had disappeared , that the <unk> had been <unk> 
open , and that the small <unk> <unk> in which , as it afterwards <unk> , the <unk> was accustomed 
to keep her jewel , was lying empty upon the <unk> - table . <unk> <unk> gave the alarm , 
and <unk> was <unk> the same evening ; but the <unk> could not be found either upon his person or 
in his rooms . <unk> <unk> , maid to the <unk> , <unk> to having heard <unk> ' s cry 
of <unk> on <unk> the <unk> , and to having rushed into the room , where she found matters as 
<unk> by the last witness . <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , gave <unk> as to the arrest of <unk> 
, who <unk> <unk> , and <unk> his <unk> in the <unk> terms . <unk> of a <unk> <unk> for 
<unk> having been given against the <unk> , the <unk> refused to deal <unk> with the <unk> , but <unk> 
it to the <unk> . <unk> , who had shown signs of <unk> emotion during the proceedings , <unk> away 
at the conclusion and was carried out of <unk> ." " hum ! so much for the police - <unk> 
," said holmes <unk> , <unk> <unk> the paper . " the question for us now to <unk> is the 
<unk> of <unk> <unk> from a <unk> jewel - case at one end to the <unk> of a <unk> in 
<unk> <unk> road at the other . you see , watson , our little <unk> have suddenly assumed a much 
more important and less <unk> <unk> . here is the <unk> ; the <unk> came from the <unk> , and 
the <unk> came from mr . <unk> baker , the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other <unk> 
with which i have <unk> you . so now we must <unk> ourselves very seriously to <unk> this gentleman and 
<unk> what part he has <unk> in this little mystery . to do this , we must <unk> the <unk> 
means first , and these lie <unk> in an <unk> in all the evening papers . if this fail , 
i shall have <unk> to other methods ." " what will you say ?" " give me a <unk> and 
that <unk> of paper . now , then : ' found at the corner of <unk> street , a <unk> 
and a black felt hat . mr . <unk> baker can have the same by <unk> at <unk> : <unk> 
this evening at <unk> , baker street .' that is clear and <unk> ." " very . but will he 
see it ?" " well , he is sure to keep an eye on the papers , since , to 
a poor man , the <unk> was a heavy one . he was <unk> so <unk> by his <unk> in 
breaking the window and by the <unk> of <unk> that he thought of nothing but flight , but since then 
he must have <unk> <unk> the impulse which caused him to drop his <unk> . then , again , the 
<unk> of his name will cause him to see it , for everyone who knows him will <unk> his attention 
to it . here you are , <unk> , run down to the <unk> <unk> and have this put in 
the evening papers ." " in which , sir ?" " oh , in the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> 
<unk> , st . <unk> ' s , evening news , <unk> , <unk> , and any others that occur 
to you ." " very well , sir . and this <unk> ?" " ah , yes , i shall 
keep the <unk> . thank you . and , i say , <unk> , just <unk> a <unk> on your 
way back and leave it here with me , for we must have one to give to this gentleman in 
<unk> of the one which your family is now <unk> ." when the <unk> had gone , holmes took up 
the <unk> and <unk> it against the light . " it ' s a <unk> thing ," said he . 
" just see how it <unk> and <unk> . of course it is a <unk> and <unk> of crime . 
every good <unk> is . they are the devil ' s <unk> <unk> . in the <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
every <unk> may <unk> for a <unk> <unk> . this <unk> is not yet twenty years old . it was 
found in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> and is remarkable in having every <unk> of the 
carbuncle , save that it is blue in <unk> instead of <unk> red . in <unk> of its youth , 
it has already a <unk> history . there have been two <unk> , a <unk> - throwing , a <unk> 
, and several <unk> brought about for the <unk> of this <unk> - <unk> weight of <unk> <unk> . who 
would think that so pretty a <unk> would be a <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk> ? i ' 
ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the <unk> to say that we 
have it ." " do you think that this man <unk> is <unk> ?" " i <unk> tell ." " 
well , then , do you imagine that this other one , <unk> baker , had anything to do with 
the matter ?" " it is , i think , much more likely that <unk> baker is an absolutely <unk> 
man , who had no <unk> that the <unk> which he was <unk> was of <unk> more <unk> than if 
it were made of <unk> gold . that , however , i shall <unk> by a very simple <unk> if 
we have an <unk> to our <unk> ." " and you can do nothing until then ?" " nothing ." 
" in that case i shall continue my <unk> round . but i shall come back in the evening at 
the hour you have <unk> , for i should like to see the <unk> of so <unk> a business ." 
" very glad to see you . i <unk> at seven . there is a <unk> , i believe . 
by the way , in view of recent <unk> , perhaps i <unk> to <unk> mrs . <unk> to <unk> 
its <unk> ." i had been <unk> at a case , and it was a little after half - past 
six when i found myself in baker street once more . as i <unk> the house i saw a tall 
man in a <unk> bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the <unk> 
<unk> which was thrown from the <unk> . just as i arrived the door was opened , and we were 
shown up together to holmes ' room . " mr . <unk> baker , i believe ," said he , 
<unk> from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of <unk> which he could so <unk> <unk> 
. " pray take this chair by the fire , mr . baker . it is a cold night , 
and i observe that your <unk> is more <unk> for <unk> than for <unk> . ah , watson , you 
have just come at the right time . is that your hat , mr . baker ?" " yes , 
sir , that is <unk> my hat ." he was a large man with <unk> shoulders , a <unk> head 
, and a broad , <unk> face , <unk> down to a <unk> <unk> of <unk> brown . a <unk> 
of red in <unk> and <unk> , with a <unk> <unk> of his extended hand , <unk> holmes ' <unk> 
as to his habits . his <unk> black <unk> - coat was buttoned right up in front , with the 
<unk> turned up , and his <unk> <unk> <unk> from his sleeves without a sign of <unk> or <unk> . 
he spoke in a slow <unk> fashion , <unk> his <unk> with care , and gave the impression generally of 
a man of <unk> and letters who had had ill - <unk> at the hands of <unk> . " we 
have <unk> these things for some days ," said holmes , " because we expected to see an <unk> from 
you <unk> your address . i am at a <unk> to know now why you did not <unk> ." our 
visitor gave a rather <unk> <unk> . " <unk> have not been so <unk> with me as they once were 
," he remarked . " i had no doubt that the gang of <unk> who <unk> me had carried off 
both my hat and the <unk> . i did not care to <unk> more money in a hopeless attempt at 
<unk> them ." " very naturally . by the way , about the <unk> , we were compelled to eat 
it ." " to eat it !" our visitor half rose from his chair in his <unk> . " yes 
, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so . but i <unk> that 
this other <unk> upon the <unk> , which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh , will <unk> your 
purpose equally well ?" " oh , certainly , certainly ," answered mr . baker with a <unk> of <unk> 
. " of course , we still have the <unk> , legs , <unk> , and so on of your 
own <unk> , so if you wish --" the man <unk> into a <unk> <unk> . " they might be 
<unk> to me as <unk> of my adventure ," said he , " but beyond that i can hardly see 
what use the <unk> <unk> of my late acquaintance are <unk> to be to me . no , sir , 
i think that , with your <unk> , i will <unk> my <unk> to the excellent <unk> which i <unk> 
upon the <unk> ." sherlock holmes glanced <unk> across at me with a <unk> <unk> of his shoulders . " 
there is your hat , then , and there your <unk> ," said he . " by the way , 
would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from ? i am <unk> of a 
<unk> <unk> , and i have seldom seen a better <unk> <unk> ." " certainly , sir ," said baker 
, who had risen and <unk> his <unk> <unk> <unk> under his arm . " there are a few of 
us who <unk> the <unk> <unk> , near the <unk> -- we are to be found in the <unk> itself 
during the day , you understand . this year our good <unk> , <unk> by name , <unk> a <unk> 
<unk> , by which , on <unk> of some few <unk> every week , we were each to <unk> a 
<unk> at <unk> . my <unk> were <unk> paid , and the rest is familiar to you . i am 
much indebted to you , sir , for a <unk> bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my <unk> 
." with a <unk> <unk> of manner he <unk> solemnly to both of us and <unk> off upon his way 
. " so much for mr . <unk> baker ," said holmes when he had <unk> the door behind him 
. " it is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter . are you <unk> , watson 
?" " not particularly ." " then i <unk> that we turn our dinner into a <unk> and follow up 
this <unk> while it is still hot ." " by all means ." it was a <unk> night , so 
we drew on our <unk> and <unk> <unk> about our <unk> . outside , the <unk> were <unk> coldly in 
a <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> of the <unk> - by <unk> out into smoke like so many <unk> 
<unk> . our <unk> rang out <unk> and <unk> as we <unk> through the <unk> ' quarter , <unk> street 
, <unk> street , and so through <unk> street into <unk> street . in a quarter of an hour we 
were in <unk> at the <unk> <unk> , which is a small <unk> - house at the corner of one 
of the streets which runs down into <unk> . holmes pushed open the door of the private <unk> and <unk> 
two <unk> of beer from the <unk> - faced , white - <unk> <unk> . " your beer should be 
excellent if it is as good as your <unk> ," said he . " my <unk> !" the man seemed 
<unk> . " yes . i was speaking only half an hour ago to mr . <unk> baker , who 
was a member of your <unk> <unk> ." " ah ! yes , i see . but you see , 
sir , them ' s not our <unk> ." " indeed ! whose , then ?" " well , i 
got the two dozen from a <unk> in <unk> garden ." " indeed ? i know some of them . 
which was it ?" " <unk> is his name ." " ah ! i don ' t know him . 
well , here ' s your good <unk> <unk> , and <unk> to your house . good - night ." 
" now for mr . <unk> ," he continued , <unk> up his coat as we came out into the 
<unk> air . " remember , watson that though we have so <unk> a thing as a <unk> at one 
end of this chain , we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years ' <unk> 
<unk> <unk> we can <unk> his <unk> . it is <unk> that our inquiry may but <unk> his <unk> ; 
but , in any case , we have a line of investigation which has been <unk> by the police , 
and which a singular chance has placed in our hands . let us follow it out to the <unk> end 
. <unk> to the <unk> , then , and quick march !" we passed across <unk> , down <unk> street 
, and so through a <unk> of <unk> to <unk> garden <unk> . one of the <unk> <unk> bore the 
name of <unk> upon it , and the <unk> a horsey - looking man , with a sharp face and 
<unk> side - <unk> was <unk> a boy to put up the <unk> . " good - evening . it 
' s a cold night ," said holmes . the <unk> <unk> and shot a questioning glance at my companion 
. " <unk> out of <unk> , i see ," continued holmes , <unk> at the <unk> <unk> of <unk> 
. " let you have five hundred to - morrow morning ." " that ' s no good ." " 
well , there are some on the <unk> with the <unk> - <unk> ." " ah , but i was 
<unk> to you ." " who by ?" " the <unk> of the <unk> ." " oh , yes ; 
i sent him a <unk> of dozen ." " fine <unk> they were , too . now where did you 
get them from ?" to my surprise the question <unk> a <unk> of <unk> from the <unk> . " now 
, then , mister ," said he , with his head <unk> and his arms <unk> , " what are 
you driving at ? let ' s have it straight , now ." " it is straight enough . i 
should like to know who <unk> you the <unk> which you <unk> to the <unk> ." " well then , 
i <unk> ' t tell you . so now !" " oh , it is a matter of no importance 
; but i don ' t know why you should be so <unk> over such a trifle ." " <unk> 
! you ' <unk> be as <unk> , <unk> , if you were as <unk> as i am . when 
i pay good money for a good <unk> there should be an end of the business ; but it ' 
s ' where are the <unk> ?' and ' who did you sell the <unk> to ?' and ' what 
will you take for the <unk> ?' one would think they were the only <unk> in the world , to 
hear the <unk> that is made over them ." " well , i have no <unk> with any other people 
who have been making <unk> ," said holmes carelessly . " if you won ' t tell us the <unk> 
is off , that is all . but i ' <unk> always <unk> to back my <unk> on a matter 
of <unk> , and i have a <unk> on it that the <unk> i <unk> is country <unk> ." " 
well , then , you ' ve lost your <unk> , for it ' s <unk> <unk> ," <unk> the 
<unk> . " it ' s nothing of the kind ." " i say it is ." " i don 
' t believe it ." " <unk> ' you think you know more about <unk> than i , who have 
<unk> them ever since i was a <unk> ? i tell you , all those <unk> that went to the 
<unk> were <unk> <unk> ." " you ' ll never <unk> me to believe that ." " will you <unk> 
, then ?" " it ' s merely taking your money , for i know that i am right . 
but i ' ll have a sovereign on with you , just to <unk> you not to be <unk> ." 
the <unk> chuckled <unk> . " bring me the books , <unk> ," said he . the small boy brought 
round a small <unk> volume and a great <unk> - <unk> one , <unk> them out together <unk> the hanging 
<unk> . " now then , mr . <unk> ," said the <unk> , " i thought that i was 
out of <unk> , but before i <unk> you ' ll find that there is still one left in my 
<unk> . you see this little book ?" " well ?" " that ' s the <unk> of the <unk> 
from whom i <unk> . <unk> ' you see ? well , then , here on this <unk> are the 
country <unk> , and the <unk> after their <unk> are where their <unk> are in the <unk> <unk> . now 
, then ! you see this other <unk> in red <unk> ? well , that is a <unk> of my 
<unk> <unk> . now , look at that <unk> name . just read it out to me ." " mrs 
. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> road -- <unk> ," read holmes . " quite so . now turn that 
up in the <unk> ." holmes turned to the <unk> indicated . " here you are , ' mrs . 
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> road , <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> " now , then , what ' s 
the last <unk> ?" "' <unk> <unk> . twenty - four <unk> at <unk> . <unk> <unk> " quite so 
. there you are . and <unk> ?" "' <unk> to mr . <unk> of the <unk> , at <unk> 
<unk> " what have you to say now ?" sherlock holmes looked deeply <unk> . he drew a sovereign from 
his pocket and threw it down upon the <unk> , <unk> away with the air of a man whose <unk> 
is too deep for <unk> . a few <unk> off he stopped under a <unk> - post and laughed in 
the <unk> , <unk> fashion which was peculiar to him . " when you see a man with <unk> of 
that <unk> and the ' pink ' <unk> ' <unk> out of his pocket , you can always draw him 
by a <unk> ," said he . " i <unk> that if i had put <unk> pounds down in front 
of him , that man would not have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the 
<unk> that he was doing me on a <unk> . well , watson , we are , i fancy , 
<unk> the end of our quest , and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should 
go on to this mrs . <unk> to - night , or whether we should <unk> it for to - 
morrow . it is clear from what that <unk> fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are <unk> 
about the matter , and i should --" his <unk> were suddenly <unk> <unk> by a loud <unk> which broke 
out from the <unk> which we had just left . <unk> round we saw a little <unk> - faced fellow 
standing in the centre of the <unk> of <unk> light which was thrown by the <unk> <unk> , while <unk> 
, the <unk> , <unk> in the door of his <unk> , was <unk> his fists <unk> at the <unk> 
figure . " i ' ve had enough of you and your <unk> ," he shouted . " i wish 
you were all at the devil together . if you come <unk> me any more with your <unk> <unk> i 
' ll <unk> the <unk> at you . you bring mrs . <unk> here and i ' ll <unk> her 
, but what have you to do with it ? did i <unk> the <unk> off you ?" " no 
; but one of them was mine all the same ," <unk> the little man . " well , then 
, <unk> mrs . <unk> for it ." " she told me to <unk> you ." " well , you 
can <unk> the king of <unk> , for all i care . i ' ve had enough of it . 
get out of this !" he rushed <unk> forward , and the <unk> <unk> away into the <unk> . " 
ha ! this may save us a visit to <unk> road ," whispered holmes . " come with me , 
and we will see what is to be made of this fellow ." <unk> through the scattered <unk> of people 
who lounged round the <unk> <unk> , my companion <unk> <unk> the little man and <unk> him upon the shoulder 
. he sprang round , and i could see in the <unk> - light that every <unk> of <unk> had 
been driven from his face . " who are you , then ? what do you want ?" he asked 
in a <unk> voice . " you will excuse me ," said holmes <unk> , " but i could not 
help <unk> the <unk> which you put to the <unk> just now . i think that i could be of 
<unk> to you ." " you ? who are you ? how could you know anything of the matter ?" 
" my name is sherlock holmes . it is my business to know what other people don ' t know 
." " but you can know nothing of this ?" " excuse me , i know <unk> of it . 
you are endeavouring to <unk> some <unk> which were <unk> by mrs . <unk> , of <unk> road , to 
a <unk> named <unk> , by him in turn to mr . <unk> , of the <unk> , and by 
him to his <unk> , of which mr . <unk> baker is a member ." " oh , sir , 
you are the very man whom i have <unk> to meet ," cried the little fellow with <unk> hands and 
<unk> <unk> . " i can hardly explain to you how interested i am in this matter ." sherlock holmes 
<unk> a four - <unk> which was passing . " in that case we had better discuss it in a 
<unk> room rather than in this wind - <unk> <unk> - <unk> ," said he . " but pray tell 
me , before we go <unk> , who it is that i have the pleasure of assisting ." the man 
hesitated for an instant . " my name is john <unk> ," he answered with a <unk> glance . " 
no , no ; the <unk> name ," said holmes <unk> . " it is always <unk> doing business with 
an <unk> ." a <unk> sprang to the white <unk> of the <unk> . " well then ," said he 
, " my <unk> name is <unk> <unk> ." " precisely so . head <unk> at the <unk> <unk> . 
pray step into the cab , and i shall soon be able to tell you <unk> which you would wish 
to know ." the little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half - <unk> , 
half - <unk> eyes , as one who is not sure whether he is on the <unk> of a <unk> 
or of a <unk> . then he stepped into the cab , and in half an hour we were back 
in the sitting - room at baker street . nothing had been said during our drive , but the high 
, <unk> breathing of our new companion , and the <unk> and <unk> of his hands , spoke of the 
nervous <unk> within him . " here we are !" said holmes <unk> as we <unk> into the room . 
" the fire <unk> very <unk> in this weather . you look cold , mr . <unk> . pray take 
the <unk> - chair . i will just put on my <unk> before we <unk> this little matter of yours 
. now , then ! you want to know what became of those <unk> ?" " yes , sir ." 
" or rather , i fancy , of that <unk> . it was one <unk> , i imagine in which 
you were interested -- white , with a black <unk> across the <unk> ." <unk> <unk> with emotion . " 
oh , sir ," he cried , " can you tell me where it went to ?" " it came 
here ." " here ?" " yes , and a most remarkable <unk> it <unk> . i don ' t 
wonder that you should take an interest in it . it laid an <unk> after it was dead -- the 
<unk> , <unk> little blue <unk> that ever was seen . i have it here in my <unk> ." our 
visitor staggered to his feet and <unk> the <unk> with his right hand . holmes <unk> his strong - box 
and <unk> up the blue carbuncle , which <unk> out like a <unk> , with a cold , <unk> , 
many - <unk> <unk> . <unk> stood <unk> with a drawn face , uncertain whether to <unk> or to <unk> 
it . " the <unk> ' s up , <unk> ," said holmes quietly . " hold up , man 
, or you ' ll be into the fire ! give him an arm back into his chair , watson 
. he ' s not got blood enough to go in for <unk> with <unk> . give him a <unk> 
of <unk> . so ! now he <unk> a little more <unk> . what a <unk> it is , to 
be sure !" for a moment he had staggered and nearly <unk> , but the <unk> brought a <unk> of 
<unk> into his <unk> , and he sat staring with <unk> eyes at his <unk> . " i have almost 
every <unk> in my hands , and all the <unk> which i could <unk> need , so there is little 
which you need tell me . still , that little may as well be <unk> up to make the case 
complete . you had heard , <unk> , of this blue <unk> of the <unk> of <unk> ' s ?" 
" it was <unk> <unk> who told me of it ," said he in a <unk> voice . " i 
see -- her <unk> ' s waiting - maid . well , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> so easily <unk> 
was too much for you , as it has been for better men before you ; but you were not 
very <unk> in the means you <unk> . it seems to me , <unk> , that there is the making 
of a very pretty <unk> in you . you knew that this man <unk> , the plumber , had been 
<unk> in some such matter before , and that suspicion would rest the more <unk> upon him . what did 
you do , then ? you made some small <unk> in my lady ' s room -- you and your 
<unk> <unk> -- and you <unk> that he should be the man sent for . then , when he had 
left , you <unk> the jewel - case , raised the alarm , and had this <unk> man <unk> . 
you then --" <unk> threw himself down suddenly upon the <unk> and <unk> at my companion ' s <unk> . 
" for god ' s <unk> , have <unk> !" he <unk> . " think of my <unk> ! of 
my <unk> ! it would <unk> their <unk> . i never went <unk> before ! i never will again . 
i <unk> it . i ' ll <unk> it on a <unk> . oh , don ' t bring it 
into <unk> ! for <unk> ' s <unk> , don ' t !" " get back into your chair !" 
said holmes <unk> . " it is very well to <unk> and <unk> now , but you thought little enough 
of this poor <unk> in the <unk> for a crime of which he knew nothing ." " i will <unk> 
, mr . holmes . i will leave the country , sir . then the <unk> against him will <unk> 
down ." " hum ! we will <unk> about that . and now let us hear a true account of 
the next <unk> . how came the <unk> into the <unk> , and how came the <unk> into the open 
<unk> ? tell us the <unk> , for there <unk> your only hope of <unk> ." <unk> passed his <unk> 
over his <unk> <unk> . " i will tell you it just as it <unk> , sir ," said he 
. " when <unk> had been <unk> , it seemed to me that it would be best for me to 
get away with the <unk> at once , for i did not know at what moment the police might not 
take it into their heads to search me and my room . there was no <unk> about the <unk> where 
it would be safe . i went out , as if on some <unk> , and i made for my 
<unk> ' s house . she had married a man named <unk> , and lived in <unk> road , where 
she <unk> <unk> for the <unk> . all the way there every man i <unk> seemed to me to be 
a <unk> or a <unk> ; and , for all that it was a cold night , the <unk> was 
<unk> down my face before i came to the <unk> road . my <unk> asked me what was the matter 
, and why i was so <unk> ; but i told her that i had been <unk> by the jewel 
<unk> at the <unk> . then i went into the back <unk> and <unk> a <unk> and <unk> what it 
would be best to do . " i had a friend once called <unk> , who went to the bad 
, and has just been <unk> his time in <unk> . one day he had <unk> me , and fell 
into <unk> about the <unk> of <unk> , and how they could get <unk> of what they <unk> . i 
knew that he would be true to me , for i knew one or two things about him ; so 
i made up my mind to go right on to <unk> , where he lived , and take him into 
my <unk> . he would show me how to turn the <unk> into money . but how to get to 
him in <unk> ? i thought of the <unk> i had gone through in coming from the <unk> . i 
might at any moment be seized and searched , and there would be the <unk> in my <unk> pocket . 
i was <unk> against the wall at the time and looking at the <unk> which were <unk> about round my 
feet , and suddenly an <unk> came into my head which showed me how i could <unk> the best <unk> 
that ever lived . " my <unk> had told me some <unk> before that i might have the <unk> of 
her <unk> for a <unk> present , and i knew that she was always as good as her word . 
i would take my <unk> now , and in it i would carry my <unk> to <unk> . there was 
a little <unk> in the <unk> , and behind this i drove one of the <unk> -- a fine <unk> 
one , white , with a <unk> <unk> . i caught it , and <unk> its <unk> open , i 
<unk> the <unk> down its <unk> as far as my <unk> could reach . the <unk> gave a <unk> , 
and i felt the <unk> pass <unk> its <unk> and down into its <unk> . but the creature <unk> and 
<unk> , and out came my <unk> to know what was the matter . as i turned to speak to 
her the <unk> broke <unk> and <unk> off among the others . "' whatever were you doing with that <unk> 
, <unk> ?' <unk> she . "' well ,' said i , ' you said you ' <unk> give me 
one for <unk> , and i was <unk> which was the <unk> .' "' oh ,' <unk> she , ' 
we ' ve <unk> yours <unk> for you -- <unk> ' s <unk> , we call it . it ' 
s the <unk> white one over <unk> . there ' s twenty - six of them , which <unk> one 
for you , and one for us , and two dozen for the <unk> .' "' thank you , <unk> 
,' <unk> i ; ' but if it is all the same to you , i ' <unk> rather have 
that one i was <unk> just now .' "' the other is a good three <unk> <unk> ,' said she 
, ' and we <unk> it <unk> for you .' "' never mind . i ' ll have the other 
, and i ' ll take it now ,' said i . "' oh , just as you like ,' 
said she , a little <unk> . ' which is it you want , then ?' "' that white one 
with the <unk> <unk> , right in the <unk> of the <unk> .' "' oh , very well . <unk> 
it and take it with you .' " well , i did what she said , mr . holmes , 
and i carried the <unk> all the way to <unk> . i told my <unk> what i had done , 
for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to . he laughed until 
he choked , and we got a <unk> and opened the <unk> . my heart turned to <unk> , for 
there was no sign of the <unk> , and i knew that some <unk> mistake had <unk> . i left 
the <unk> , rushed back to my <unk> ' s , and hurried into the back <unk> . there was 
not a <unk> to be seen there . "' where are they all , <unk> ?' i cried . "' 
gone to the <unk> ' s , <unk> .' "' which <unk> ' s ?' "' <unk> , of <unk> 
garden .' "' but was there another with a <unk> <unk> ?' i asked , ' the same as the 
one i <unk> ?' "' yes , <unk> ; there were two <unk> - <unk> <unk> , and i could 
never tell them apart .' " well , then , of course i saw it all , and i ran 
off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man <unk> ; but he had <unk> the <unk> 
at once , and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone . you heard 
him <unk> to - night . well , he has always answered me like that . my <unk> thinks that 
i am <unk> mad . <unk> i think that i am myself . and now -- and now i am 
myself a <unk> <unk> , without ever having <unk> the <unk> for which i <unk> my character . god help 
me ! god help me !" he <unk> into <unk> <unk> , with his face buried in his hands . 
there was a long silence , broken only by his heavy breathing and by the <unk> <unk> of sherlock holmes 
' <unk> - <unk> upon the <unk> of the table . then my friend rose and threw open the door 
. " get out !" said he . " what , sir ! oh , <unk> <unk> you !" " 
no more <unk> . get out !" and no more <unk> were <unk> . there was a rush , a 
<unk> upon the stairs , the <unk> of a door , and the <unk> <unk> of running <unk> from the 
street . " after all , watson ," said holmes , <unk> up his hand for his <unk> <unk> , 
" i am not <unk> by the police to <unk> their <unk> . if <unk> were in <unk> it would 
be another thing ; but this fellow will not <unk> against him , and the case must <unk> . i 
suppose that i am <unk> a <unk> , but it is just <unk> that i am <unk> a soul . 
this fellow will not go <unk> again ; he is too <unk> <unk> . send him to <unk> now , 
and you make him a <unk> - <unk> for life . besides , it is the <unk> of <unk> . 
chance has put in our way a most singular and <unk> problem , and its <unk> is its own reward 
. if you will have the <unk> to <unk> the bell , doctor , we will begin another investigation , 
in which , also a <unk> will be the <unk> <unk> ." viii . the adventure of the speckled band 
on glancing over my notes of the <unk> <unk> cases in which i have during the last eight years <unk> 
the methods of my friend sherlock holmes , i find many <unk> , some <unk> , a large number merely 
strange , but none <unk> ; for , <unk> as he did rather for the love of his <unk> than 
for the <unk> of <unk> , he refused to <unk> himself with any investigation which did not <unk> towards the 
unusual , and even the <unk> . of all these <unk> cases , however , i <unk> <unk> any which 
<unk> more singular features than that which was associated with the well - known <unk> family of the <unk> of 
<unk> <unk> . the <unk> in question <unk> in the <unk> days of my <unk> with holmes , when we 
were <unk> rooms as <unk> in baker street . it is <unk> that i might have placed them upon <unk> 
before , but a promise of secrecy was made at the time , from which i have only been <unk> 
during the last <unk> by the <unk> death of the lady to whom the <unk> was given . it is 
perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light , for i have reasons to know that there 
are <unk> <unk> as to the death of dr . <unk> <unk> which <unk> to make the matter even more 
<unk> than the <unk> . it was <unk> in april in the year ' <unk> that i <unk> one morning 
to find sherlock holmes standing , <unk> dressed , by the side of my <unk> . he was a late 
<unk> , as a <unk> , and as the clock on the <unk> showed me that it was only a 
quarter - past seven , i <unk> up at him in some surprise , and perhaps just a little <unk> 
, for i was myself <unk> in my habits . " very sorry to <unk> you up , watson ," 
said he , " but it ' s the <unk> <unk> this morning . mrs . <unk> has been <unk> 
up , she <unk> upon me , and i on you ." " what is it , then -- a 
fire ?" " no ; a client . it seems that a young lady has arrived in a <unk> state 
of <unk> , who <unk> upon <unk> me . she is waiting now in the sitting - room . now 
, when young <unk> <unk> about the <unk> at this hour of the morning , and <unk> <unk> people up 
out of their <unk> , i <unk> that it is something very <unk> which they have to communicate . should 
it prove to be an interesting case , you would , i am sure , wish to follow it from 
the <unk> . i thought , at any <unk> , that i should call you and give you the chance 
." " my dear fellow , i would not miss it for anything ." i had no <unk> pleasure than 
in following holmes in his <unk> <unk> , and in <unk> the <unk> <unk> , as <unk> as <unk> , 
and yet always <unk> on a <unk> <unk> with which he <unk> the problems which were <unk> to him . 
i <unk> threw on my clothes and was <unk> in a few minutes to <unk> my friend down to the 
sitting - room . a lady dressed in black and <unk> <unk> , who had been sitting in the window 
, rose as we entered . " good - morning , <unk> ," said holmes <unk> . " my name 
is sherlock holmes . this is my <unk> friend and <unk> , dr . watson , before whom you can 
speak as freely as before myself . ha ! i am glad to see that mrs . <unk> has had 
the good <unk> to light the fire . pray draw up to it , and i shall order you a 
<unk> of hot coffee , for i observe that you are <unk> ." " it is not cold which <unk> 
me <unk> ," said the woman in a <unk> voice , <unk> her seat as <unk> . " what , 
then ?" " it is fear , mr . holmes . it is <unk> ." she raised her veil as 
she spoke , and we could see that she was indeed in a <unk> state of agitation , her face 
all drawn and <unk> , with <unk> <unk> eyes , like those of some <unk> <unk> . her features and 
figure were those of a woman of thirty , but her <unk> was shot with <unk> <unk> , and her 
expression was <unk> and <unk> . sherlock holmes ran her over with one of his quick , all - <unk> 
<unk> . " you must not fear ," said he <unk> , <unk> forward and <unk> her <unk> . " 
we shall soon <unk> matters right , i have no doubt . you have come in by train this morning 
, i see ." " you know me , then ?" " no , but i observe the second half 
of a return <unk> in the palm of your left <unk> . you must have started <unk> , and yet 
you had a good drive in a <unk> - <unk> , <unk> heavy <unk> , before you reached the station 
." the lady gave a <unk> start and <unk> in <unk> at my companion . " there is no mystery 
, my dear <unk> ," said he , <unk> . " the left arm of your <unk> is <unk> with 
mud in no less than seven <unk> . the <unk> are perfectly fresh . there is no <unk> save a 
<unk> - <unk> which <unk> up mud in that way , and then only when you sit on the left 
- hand side of the driver ." " whatever your reasons may be , you are perfectly <unk> ," said 
she . " i started from home before six , reached <unk> at twenty past , and came in by 
the first train to <unk> . sir , i can <unk> this <unk> no <unk> ; i shall go mad 
if it <unk> . i have no one to turn to -- none , save only one , who <unk> 
for me , and he , poor fellow , can be of little <unk> . i have heard of you 
, mr . holmes ; i have heard of you from mrs . <unk> , whom you <unk> in the 
hour of her <unk> need . it was from her that i had your address . oh , sir , 
do you not think that you could help me , too , and at least throw a little light through 
the <unk> <unk> which <unk> me ? at present it is out of my power to reward you for your 
services , but in a <unk> or six <unk> i shall be married , with the <unk> of my own 
<unk> , and then at least you shall not find me <unk> ." holmes turned to his <unk> and , 
<unk> it , drew out a small case - book , which he <unk> . " <unk> ," said he 
. " ah yes , i <unk> the case ; it was <unk> with an <unk> <unk> . i think 
it was before your time , watson . i can only say , <unk> , that i shall be <unk> 
to <unk> the same care to your case as i did to that of your friend . as to reward 
, my profession is its own reward ; but you are at <unk> to <unk> whatever expenses i may be 
put to , at the time which suits you best . and now i <unk> that you will lay before 
us <unk> that may help us in <unk> an <unk> upon the matter ." " <unk> !" <unk> our visitor 
, " the very <unk> of my situation <unk> in the <unk> that my <unk> are so vague , and 
my <unk> <unk> so entirely upon small <unk> , which might <unk> <unk> to another , that even he to 
whom of all others i have a right to look for help and <unk> <unk> upon all that i tell 
him about it as the <unk> of a nervous woman . he does not say so , but i can 
read it from his <unk> <unk> and <unk> eyes . but i have heard , mr . holmes , that 
you can see deeply into the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> heart . you may advise me how to walk 
<unk> the <unk> which <unk> me ." " i am all attention , <unk> ." " my name is <unk> 
<unk> , and i am living with my <unk> , who is the last <unk> of one of the <unk> 
<unk> families in england , the <unk> of <unk> <unk> , on the <unk> <unk> of <unk> ." holmes <unk> 
his head . " the name is familiar to me ," said he . " the family was at one 
time among the <unk> in england , and the <unk> extended over the <unk> into <unk> in the <unk> , 
and <unk> in the <unk> . in the last <unk> , however , four successive <unk> were of a <unk> 
and <unk> <unk> , and the family ruin was <unk> completed by a <unk> in the days of the <unk> 
. nothing was left save a few <unk> of ground , and the two - hundred - year - old 
house , which is itself <unk> under a heavy <unk> . the last <unk> dragged out his <unk> there , 
living the <unk> life of an <unk> <unk> ; but his only <unk> , my <unk> , <unk> that he 
must <unk> himself to the new <unk> , <unk> an <unk> from a <unk> , which <unk> him to take 
a medical <unk> and went out to <unk> , where , by his <unk> <unk> and his <unk> of character 
, he <unk> a large practice . in a <unk> of <unk> , however , caused by some <unk> which 
had been <unk> in the house , he <unk> his <unk> <unk> to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence 
. as it was , he <unk> a long <unk> of <unk> and afterwards returned to england a <unk> and 
<unk> man . " when dr . <unk> was in <unk> he married my <unk> , mrs . <unk> , 
the young <unk> of <unk> - general <unk> , of the <unk> <unk> . my <unk> <unk> and i were 
<unk> , and we were only two years old at the time of my <unk> ' s re - marriage 
. she had a <unk> <unk> of money -- not less than <unk> pounds a year -- and this she 
<unk> to dr . <unk> entirely while we <unk> with him , with a <unk> that a certain <unk> <unk> 
should be <unk> to each of us in the <unk> of our marriage . shortly after our return to england 
my <unk> <unk> -- she was <unk> eight years ago in a <unk> <unk> near <unk> . dr . <unk> 
then abandoned his attempts to <unk> himself in practice in london and took us to <unk> with him in the 
old <unk> house at <unk> <unk> . the money which my <unk> had left was enough for all our <unk> 
, and there seemed to be no <unk> to our happiness . " but a <unk> change came over our 
<unk> about this time . instead of making <unk> and <unk> visits with our <unk> , who had at first 
been <unk> to see a <unk> of <unk> <unk> back in the old family seat , he <unk> himself up 
in his house and seldom came out save to <unk> in <unk> <unk> with <unk> might cross his <unk> . 
<unk> of <unk> <unk> to <unk> has been hereditary in the men of the family , and in my <unk> 
' s case it had , i believe , been <unk> by his long <unk> in the <unk> . a 
<unk> of <unk> <unk> took <unk> , two of which ended in the police - <unk> , until at last 
he became the <unk> of the <unk> , and the <unk> would <unk> at his <unk> , for he is 
a man of immense <unk> , and absolutely uncontrollable in his <unk> . " last week he hurled the <unk> 
<unk> over a <unk> into a <unk> , and it was only by <unk> over all the money which i 
could <unk> together that i was able to <unk> another <unk> <unk> . he had no <unk> at all save 
the <unk> <unk> , and he would give these <unk> leave to <unk> upon the few <unk> of <unk> - 
<unk> <unk> which <unk> the family <unk> , and would <unk> in return the <unk> of their <unk> , <unk> 
away with them <unk> for <unk> on end . he has a <unk> also for <unk> <unk> , which are 
sent over to him by a <unk> , and he has at this moment a <unk> and a <unk> , 
which <unk> freely over his <unk> and are <unk> by the <unk> almost as much as their master . " 
you can imagine from what i say that my poor <unk> <unk> and i had no great pleasure in our 
lives . no servant would stay with us , and for a long time we did all the work of 
the house . she was but thirty at the time of her death , and yet her <unk> had already 
<unk> to <unk> , even as mine has ." " your <unk> is dead , then ?" " she <unk> 
just two years ago , and it is of her death that i wish to speak to you . you 
can understand that , living the life which i have <unk> , we were little likely to see anyone of 
our own <unk> and position . we had , however , an <unk> , my <unk> ' s <unk> <unk> 
, miss <unk> <unk> , who lives near <unk> , and we were occasionally <unk> to pay <unk> visits at 
this lady ' s house . <unk> went there at <unk> two years ago , and <unk> there a half 
- pay <unk> of <unk> , to whom she became engaged . my <unk> <unk> of the <unk> when my 
<unk> returned and <unk> no <unk> to the marriage ; but within a <unk> of the day which had been 
<unk> for the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> <unk> which has <unk> me of my only companion ." sherlock holmes 
had been <unk> back in his chair with his eyes <unk> and his head sunk in a <unk> , but 
he half opened his <unk> now and glanced across at his visitor . " pray be precise as to details 
," said he . " it is easy for me to be so , for every <unk> of that dreadful 
time is <unk> into my memory . the <unk> - house is , as i have already said , very 
old , and only one <unk> is now <unk> . the <unk> in this <unk> are on the ground floor 
, the sitting - rooms being in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> . of these <unk> the first is 
dr . <unk> ' s , the second my <unk> ' s , and the <unk> my own . there 
is no <unk> between them , but they all open out into the same <unk> . do i make myself 
<unk> ?" " perfectly so ." " the windows of the three rooms open out upon the <unk> . that 
<unk> night dr . <unk> had gone to his room <unk> , though we knew that he had not retired 
to rest , for my <unk> was <unk> by the <unk> of the strong <unk> cigars which it was his 
<unk> to smoke . she left her room , therefore , and came into mine , where she sat for 
some time , <unk> about her <unk> <unk> . at <unk> o ' clock she rose to leave me , 
but she paused at the door and looked back . "' tell me , <unk> ,' said she , ' 
have you ever heard anyone <unk> in the dead of the night ?' "' never ,' said i . "' 
i suppose that you could not <unk> <unk> , yourself , in your <unk> ?' "' certainly not . but 
why ?' "' because during the last few <unk> i have always , about three in the morning , heard 
a <unk> , clear <unk> . i am a light <unk> , and it has <unk> me . i <unk> 
tell where it came from -- perhaps from the next room , perhaps from the <unk> . i thought that 
i would just <unk> you whether you had heard it .' "' no , i have not . it must 
be those <unk> <unk> in the <unk> .' "' very likely . and yet if it were on the <unk> 
, i wonder that you did not hear it also .' "' ah , but i <unk> more <unk> than 
you .' "' well , it is of no great <unk> , at any <unk> .' she <unk> back at 
me , <unk> my door , and a few <unk> later i heard her key turn in the lock ." 
" indeed ," said holmes . " was it your <unk> always to lock <unk> in at night ?" " 
always ." " and why ?" " i think that i <unk> to you that the doctor <unk> a <unk> 
and a <unk> . we had no <unk> of <unk> <unk> our <unk> were <unk> ." " quite so . 
pray <unk> with your <unk> ." " i could not <unk> that night . a vague <unk> of <unk> <unk> 
<unk> me . my <unk> and i , you will <unk> , were <unk> , and you know how subtle 
are the <unk> which <unk> two <unk> which are so closely <unk> . it was a <unk> night . the 
wind was <unk> outside , and the <unk> was <unk> and <unk> against the windows . suddenly , <unk> all 
the <unk> of the <unk> , there <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> woman . i knew that 
it was my <unk> ' s voice . i sprang from my <unk> , <unk> a <unk> round me , 
and rushed into the <unk> . as i opened my door i seemed to hear a <unk> <unk> , such 
as my <unk> <unk> , and a few <unk> later a <unk> sound , as if a <unk> of <unk> 
had <unk> . as i ran down the passage , my <unk> ' s door was <unk> , and <unk> 
slowly upon its <unk> . i <unk> at it <unk> - <unk> , not <unk> what was about to issue 
from it . by the light of the <unk> - <unk> i saw my <unk> <unk> at the opening , 
her face <unk> with <unk> , her hands <unk> for help , her whole figure <unk> to and fro like 
that of a <unk> . i ran to her and threw my arms round her , but at that moment 
her <unk> seemed to give way and she fell to the ground . she <unk> as one who is in 
<unk> <unk> , and her limbs were <unk> <unk> . at first i thought that she had not <unk> me 
, but as i <unk> over her she suddenly <unk> out in a voice which i shall never <unk> , 
' oh , my god ! <unk> ! it was the band ! the speckled band !' there was something 
else which she would <unk> have said , and she <unk> with her <unk> into the air in the direction 
of the doctor ' s room , but a fresh <unk> seized her and choked her <unk> . i rushed 
out , <unk> <unk> for my <unk> , and i <unk> him <unk> from his room in his <unk> - 
<unk> . when he reached my <unk> ' s side she was <unk> , and though he <unk> <unk> down 
her <unk> and sent for medical <unk> from the <unk> , all <unk> were in <unk> , for she slowly 
<unk> and <unk> without having recovered her <unk> . such was the dreadful end of my <unk> <unk> ." " 
one moment ," said holmes , " are you sure about this <unk> and <unk> sound ? could you <unk> 
to it ?" " that was what the <unk> <unk> asked me at the inquiry . it is my strong 
impression that i heard it , and yet , among the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> of an 
old house , i may <unk> have been <unk> ." " was your <unk> dressed ?" " no , she 
was in her night - dress . in her right hand was found the <unk> <unk> of a <unk> , 
and in her left a <unk> - box ." " showing that she had struck a light and looked about 
her when the alarm took <unk> . that is important . and what <unk> did the <unk> come to ?" 
" he <unk> the case with great care , for dr . <unk> ' s conduct had long been <unk> 
in the <unk> , but he was <unk> to find any <unk> cause of death . my <unk> showed that 
the door had been <unk> upon the inner side , and the windows were <unk> by old - <unk> <unk> 
with broad <unk> <unk> , which were secured every night . the <unk> were carefully sounded , and were shown 
to be quite <unk> all round , and the <unk> was also thoroughly examined , with the same result . 
the <unk> is <unk> , but is <unk> up by four large <unk> . it is certain , therefore , 
that my <unk> was quite alone when she <unk> her end . besides , there were no <unk> of any 
<unk> upon her ." " how about <unk> ?" " the <unk> examined her for it , but without success 
." " what do you think that this <unk> lady <unk> of , then ?" " it is my <unk> 
that she <unk> of <unk> fear and nervous <unk> , though what it was that <unk> her i <unk> imagine 
." " were there <unk> in the <unk> at the time ?" " yes , there are nearly always some 
there ." " ah , and what did you <unk> from this <unk> to a band -- a speckled band 
?" " <unk> i have thought that it was merely the <unk> <unk> of <unk> , <unk> that it may 
have <unk> to some band of people , perhaps to these very <unk> in the <unk> . i do not 
know whether the <unk> <unk> which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange <unk> 
which she <unk> ." holmes <unk> his head like a man who is far from being <unk> . " these 
are very deep <unk> ," said he ; " pray go on with your <unk> ." " two years have 
passed since then , and my life has been until lately <unk> than ever . a <unk> ago , however 
, a dear friend , whom i have known for many years , has done me the honour to <unk> 
my hand in marriage . his name is <unk> -- <unk> <unk> -- the second <unk> of mr . <unk> 
, of <unk> <unk> , near <unk> . my <unk> has <unk> no <unk> to the <unk> , and we 
are to be married in the course of the <unk> . two days ago some <unk> were started in the 
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> , and my bedroom wall has been <unk> , so that i have had to 
<unk> into the chamber in which my <unk> <unk> , and to <unk> in the very <unk> in which she 
slept . imagine , then , my <unk> of <unk> when last night , as i lay <unk> , <unk> 
over her <unk> <unk> , i suddenly heard in the silence of the night the <unk> <unk> which had been 
the <unk> of her own death . i sprang up and lit the <unk> , but nothing was to be 
seen in the room . i was too <unk> to go to <unk> again , however , so i dressed 
, and as soon as it was <unk> i <unk> down , got a <unk> - <unk> at the crown 
<unk> , which is <unk> , and drove to <unk> , from whence i have come on this morning with 
the one object of <unk> you and <unk> your <unk> ." " you have done <unk> ," said my friend 
. " but have you told me all ?" " yes , all ." " miss <unk> , you have 
not . you are <unk> your <unk> ." " why , what do you mean ?" for <unk> holmes pushed 
back the <unk> of black <unk> which <unk> the hand that lay upon our visitor ' s <unk> . five 
little <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of four <unk> and a thumb , were <unk> upon the white wrist . 
" you have been cruelly <unk> ," said holmes . the lady coloured deeply and <unk> over her injured wrist 
. " he is a hard man ," she said , " and perhaps he hardly knows his own <unk> 
." there was a long silence , during which holmes <unk> his chin upon his hands and <unk> into the 
<unk> fire . " this is a very deep business ," he said at last . " there are a 
<unk> details which i should desire to know before i <unk> upon our course of action . yet we have 
not a moment to lose . if we were to come to <unk> <unk> to - day , would it 
be <unk> for us to see over these rooms without the <unk> of your <unk> ?" " as it <unk> 
, he spoke of coming into <unk> to - day upon some most important business . it is probable that 
he will be away all day , and that there would be nothing to <unk> you . we have a 
<unk> now , but she is old and <unk> , and i could easily get her out of the way 
." " excellent . you are not averse to this <unk> , watson ?" " by no means ." " 
then we shall both come . what are you <unk> to do yourself ?" " i have one or two 
things which i would wish to do now that i am in <unk> . but i shall return by the 
twelve o ' clock train , so as to be there in time for your coming ." " and you 
may <unk> us <unk> in the afternoon . i have myself some small business matters to attend to . will 
you not wait and <unk> ?" " no , i must go . my heart is <unk> already since i 
have <unk> my <unk> to you . i shall look forward to <unk> you again this afternoon ." she dropped 
her thick black veil over her face and <unk> from the room . " and what do you think of 
it all , watson ?" asked sherlock holmes , <unk> back in his chair . " it seems to me 
to be a most dark and <unk> business ." " dark enough and <unk> enough ." " yet if the 
lady is <unk> in <unk> that the <unk> and <unk> are sound , and that the door , window , 
and <unk> are <unk> , then her <unk> must have been <unk> alone when she <unk> her <unk> end ." 
" what becomes , then , of these <unk> <unk> , and what of the very peculiar <unk> of the 
<unk> woman ?" " i <unk> think ." " when you <unk> the <unk> of <unk> at night , the 
<unk> of a band of <unk> who are on <unk> terms with this old doctor , the <unk> that we 
have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his <unk> ' s marriage , the 
<unk> <unk> to a band , and , finally , the <unk> that miss <unk> <unk> heard a <unk> <unk> 
, which might have been caused by one of those <unk> <unk> that secured the <unk> <unk> back into its 
<unk> , i think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be <unk> <unk> those <unk> 
." " but what , then , did the <unk> do ?" " i <unk> imagine ." " i see 
many <unk> to any such <unk> ." " and so do i . it is precisely for that reason that 
we are <unk> to <unk> <unk> this day . i want to see whether the <unk> are <unk> , or 
if they may be explained away . but what in the name of the devil !" the <unk> had been 
drawn from my companion by the <unk> that our door had been suddenly dashed open , and that a <unk> 
man had <unk> himself in the <unk> . his costume was a peculiar <unk> of the <unk> and of the 
<unk> , having a black top - hat , a long <unk> - coat , and a pair of high 
<unk> , with a <unk> - <unk> <unk> in his hand . so tall was he that his hat <unk> 
brushed the cross <unk> of the <unk> , and his <unk> seemed to <unk> it across from side to side 
. a large face , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> , burned <unk> with the <unk> , and marked with 
every evil <unk> , was turned from one to the other of us , while his deep - <unk> , 
<unk> - shot eyes , and his high , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , gave him <unk> the <unk> to 
a fierce old <unk> of <unk> . " which of you is holmes ?" asked this <unk> . " my 
name , sir ; but you have the advantage of me ," said my companion quietly . " i am 
dr . <unk> <unk> , of <unk> <unk> ." " indeed , doctor ," said holmes <unk> . " pray 
take a seat ." " i will do nothing of the kind . my <unk> has been here . i 
have <unk> her . what has she been <unk> to you ?" " it is a little cold for the 
time of the year ," said holmes . " what has she been <unk> to you ?" <unk> the old 
man <unk> . " but i have heard that the <unk> promise well ," continued my companion <unk> . " 
ha ! you put me off , do you ?" said our new visitor , taking a step forward and 
<unk> his <unk> - <unk> . " i know you , you <unk> ! i have heard of you before 
. you are holmes , the <unk> ." my friend <unk> . " holmes , the <unk> !" his smile 
<unk> . " holmes , the <unk> <unk> <unk> - in - <unk> !" holmes chuckled heartily . " your 
<unk> is most <unk> ," said he . " when you go out close the door , for there is 
a <unk> <unk> ." " i will go when i have said my say . don ' t you <unk> 
to <unk> with my affairs . i know that miss <unk> has been here . i <unk> her ! i 
am a <unk> man to fall <unk> of ! see here ." he stepped swiftly forward , seized the <unk> 
, and <unk> it into a curve with his <unk> brown hands . " see that you keep yourself out 
of my <unk> ," he <unk> , and <unk> the twisted <unk> into the <unk> he <unk> out of the 
room . " he seems a very amiable person ," said holmes , laughing . " i am not quite 
so <unk> , but if he had remained i might have shown him that my <unk> was not much more 
<unk> than his own ." as he spoke he <unk> up the steel <unk> and , with a <unk> <unk> 
, <unk> it out again . " fancy his having the <unk> to <unk> me with the official <unk> <unk> 
! this <unk> gives <unk> to our investigation , however , and i only trust that our little friend will 
not <unk> from her <unk> in <unk> this <unk> to <unk> her . and now , watson , we shall 
order <unk> , and afterwards i shall walk down to <unk> ' <unk> , where i hope to get some 
data which may help us in this matter ." it was nearly one o ' clock when sherlock holmes returned 
from his <unk> . he <unk> in his hand a sheet of blue paper , <unk> over with notes and 
figures . " i have seen the will of the <unk> wife ," said he . " to <unk> its 
<unk> <unk> i have been obliged to work out the present <unk> of the <unk> with which it is <unk> 
. the <unk> <unk> , which at the time of the wife ' s death was little <unk> of <unk> 
pounds , is now , through the fall in <unk> <unk> , not more than <unk> pounds . each daughter 
can <unk> an <unk> of <unk> pounds , in case of marriage . it is <unk> , therefore , that 
if both <unk> had married , this <unk> would have had a <unk> <unk> , while even one of them 
would <unk> him to a very serious <unk> . my morning ' s work has not been <unk> , since 
it has <unk> that he has the very <unk> motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort 
. and now , watson , this is too serious for <unk> , <unk> as the old man is aware 
that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs ; so if you are <unk> , we shall call a cab 
and drive to <unk> . i should be very much obliged if you would <unk> your <unk> into your pocket 
. an <unk> ' s no . <unk> is an excellent <unk> with gentlemen who can twist steel <unk> into 
<unk> . that and a <unk> - <unk> are , i think , all that we need ." at <unk> 
we were fortunate in <unk> a train for <unk> , where we <unk> a <unk> at the station <unk> and 
drove for four or five <unk> through the lovely <unk> <unk> . it was a perfect day , with a 
<unk> <unk> and a few <unk> clouds in the <unk> . the <unk> and <unk> <unk> were just throwing out 
their first <unk> <unk> , and the air was <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the moist <unk> . to 
me at least there was a strange <unk> between the <unk> promise of the <unk> and this <unk> quest upon 
which we were engaged . my companion sat in the front of the <unk> , his arms <unk> , his 
hat pulled down over his eyes , and his chin sunk upon his <unk> , buried in the deepest thought 
. suddenly , however , he started , <unk> me on the shoulder , and <unk> over the <unk> . 
" look there !" said he . a <unk> <unk> park stretched up in a <unk> <unk> , <unk> into 
a <unk> at the <unk> point . from <unk> the <unk> there <unk> out the <unk> <unk> and high <unk> 
- <unk> of a very old <unk> . " <unk> <unk> ?" said he . " yes , sir , 
that be the house of dr . <unk> <unk> ," remarked the driver . " there is some <unk> <unk> 
on there ," said holmes ; " that is where we are <unk> ." " there ' s the <unk> 
," said the driver , <unk> to a <unk> of <unk> some <unk> to the left ; " but if 
you want to get to the house , you ' ll find it <unk> to get over this <unk> , 
and so by the <unk> - <unk> over the <unk> . there it is , where the lady is walking 
." " and the lady , i fancy , is miss <unk> ," observed holmes , <unk> his eyes . 
" yes , i think we had better do as you <unk> ." we got off , paid our fare 
, and the <unk> rattled back on its way to <unk> . " i thought it as well ," said 
holmes as we <unk> the <unk> , " that this fellow should think we had come here as <unk> , 
or on some <unk> business . it may <unk> his <unk> . good - afternoon , miss <unk> . you 
see that we have been as good as our word ." our client of the morning had hurried forward to 
meet us with a face which spoke her <unk> . " i have been waiting so eagerly for you ," 
she cried , <unk> hands with us <unk> . " all has turned out <unk> . dr . <unk> has 
gone to <unk> , and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening ." " we have had 
the pleasure of making the doctor ' s acquaintance ," said holmes , and in a few <unk> he <unk> 
out what had <unk> . miss <unk> turned white to the <unk> as she listened . " good <unk> !" 
she cried , " he has followed me , then ." " so it appears ." " he is so 
<unk> that i never know when i am safe from him . what will he say when he returns ?" 
" he must <unk> himself , for he may find that there is someone more <unk> than himself upon his 
<unk> . you must lock yourself up from him to - night . if he is <unk> , we shall 
take you away to your <unk> ' s at <unk> . now , we must make the best use of 
our time , so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to <unk> ." the <unk> 
was of <unk> , <unk> - <unk> <unk> , with a high <unk> <unk> and two <unk> <unk> , like 
the <unk> of a <unk> , thrown out on each side . in one of these <unk> the windows were 
broken and <unk> with <unk> <unk> , while the <unk> was <unk> <unk> in , a <unk> of ruin . 
the <unk> <unk> was in little better <unk> , but the right - hand <unk> was <unk> <unk> , and 
the blinds in the windows , with the blue smoke <unk> up from the <unk> , showed that this was 
where the family <unk> . some <unk> had been <unk> against the end wall , and the <unk> - work 
had been broken into , but there were no signs of any <unk> at the moment of our visit . 
holmes walked slowly up and down the ill - trimmed <unk> and examined with deep attention the <unk> of the 
windows . " this , i take it , <unk> to the room in which you <unk> to <unk> , 
the centre one to your <unk> ' s , and the one next to the <unk> <unk> to dr . 
<unk> ' s chamber ?" " exactly so . but i am now <unk> in the <unk> one ." " 
<unk> the <unk> , as i understand . by the way , there does not <unk> to be any very 
<unk> need for <unk> at that end wall ." " there were none . i believe that it was an 
excuse to <unk> me from my room ." " ah ! that is suggestive . now , on the other 
side of this <unk> <unk> runs the <unk> from which these three rooms open . there are windows in it 
, of course ?" " yes , but very small <unk> . too <unk> for anyone to pass through ." 
" as you both <unk> your <unk> at night , your rooms were <unk> from that side . now , 
would you have the <unk> to go into your room and <unk> your <unk> ?" miss <unk> did so , 
and holmes , after a <unk> <unk> through the open window , <unk> in every way to <unk> the shutter 
open , but without success . there was no <unk> through which a <unk> could be passed to raise the 
<unk> . then with his <unk> he <unk> the <unk> , but they were of <unk> <unk> , built <unk> 
into the <unk> <unk> . " hum !" said he , <unk> his chin in some <unk> , " my 
<unk> certainly <unk> some difficulties . no one could pass these <unk> if they were <unk> . well , we 
shall see if the inside <unk> any light upon the matter ." a small side door led into the <unk> 
<unk> from which the three <unk> opened . holmes refused to <unk> the <unk> chamber , so we passed at 
once to the second , that in which miss <unk> was now <unk> , and in which her <unk> had 
<unk> with her <unk> . it was a <unk> little room , with a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> <unk> 
, after the fashion of old country - houses . a brown chest of drawers stood in one corner , 
a <unk> white - <unk> <unk> in another , and a <unk> - table on the left - hand side 
of the window . these <unk> , with two small <unk> - work <unk> , made up all the furniture 
in the room save for a <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the centre . the <unk> round and the <unk> 
of the <unk> were of brown , <unk> - <unk> <unk> , so old and <unk> that it may have 
dated from the <unk> <unk> of the house . holmes drew one of the <unk> into a corner and sat 
<unk> , while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down , taking in every <unk> of the 
<unk> . " where does that bell communicate with ?" he asked at last <unk> to a thick bell - 
<unk> which <unk> down beside the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> lying upon the <unk> . " it goes to 
the <unk> ' s room ." " it <unk> <unk> than the other things ?" " yes , it was 
only put there a <unk> of years ago ." " your <unk> asked for it , i suppose ?" " 
no , i never heard of her <unk> it . we <unk> always to get what we wanted for ourselves 
." " indeed , it seemed <unk> to put so nice a bell - pull there . you will excuse 
me for a few minutes while i <unk> myself as to this floor ." he threw himself down upon his 
face with his <unk> in his hand and <unk> swiftly <unk> and forward , <unk> <unk> the <unk> between the 
<unk> . then he did the same with the wood - work with which the chamber was <unk> . finally 
he walked over to the <unk> and <unk> some time in staring at it and in running his eye up 
and down the wall . finally he took the bell - <unk> in his hand and gave it a <unk> 
<unk> . " why , it ' s a <unk> ," said he . " won ' t it ring 
?" " no , it is not even <unk> to a wire . this is very interesting . you can 
see now that it is <unk> to a <unk> just above where the little opening for the <unk> is ." 
" how very <unk> ! i never <unk> that before ." " very strange !" <unk> holmes , <unk> at 
the <unk> . " there are one or two very singular <unk> about this room . for example , what 
a <unk> a <unk> must be to open a <unk> into another room , when , with the same <unk> 
, he might have <unk> with the outside air !" " that is also quite <unk> ," said the lady 
. " done about the same time as the bell - <unk> ?" remarked holmes . " yes , there 
were several little <unk> carried out about that time ." " they <unk> to have been of a most interesting 
character -- <unk> bell - <unk> , and <unk> which do not <unk> . with your <unk> , miss <unk> 
, we shall now carry our <unk> into the inner <unk> ." dr . <unk> <unk> ' s chamber was 
<unk> than that of his step - daughter , but was as plainly furnished . a <unk> - <unk> , 
a small <unk> <unk> <unk> of books , <unk> of a <unk> character , an armchair beside the <unk> , 
a <unk> <unk> chair against the wall , a round table , and a large <unk> safe were the principal 
things which <unk> the eye . holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the <unk> 
interest . " what ' s in here ?" he asked , <unk> the safe . " my <unk> ' 
s business papers ." " oh ! you have seen inside , then ?" " only once , some years 
ago . i remember that it was <unk> of papers ." " there <unk> ' t a <unk> in it 
, for example ?" " no . what a strange <unk> !" " well , look at this !" he 
took up a small <unk> of <unk> which stood on the top of it . " no ; we don 
' t keep a <unk> . but there is a <unk> and a <unk> ." " ah , yes , 
of course ! well , a <unk> is just a <unk> <unk> , and yet a <unk> of <unk> does 
not go very far in <unk> its <unk> , i <unk> . there is one point which i should wish 
to <unk> ." he <unk> down in front of the <unk> chair and examined the seat of it with the 
<unk> attention . " thank you . that is quite <unk> ," said he , <unk> and putting his <unk> 
in his pocket . " <unk> ! here is something interesting !" the object which had caught his eye was 
a small <unk> <unk> <unk> on one corner of the <unk> . the <unk> , however , was curled upon 
itself and <unk> so as to make a <unk> of <unk> . " what do you make of that , 
watson ?" " it ' s a <unk> enough <unk> . but i don ' t know why it should 
be <unk> ." " that is not quite so <unk> , is it ? ah , me ! it ' 
s a <unk> world , and when a <unk> man <unk> his <unk> to crime it is the <unk> of 
all . i think that i have seen enough now , miss <unk> , and with your <unk> we shall 
walk out upon the <unk> ." i had never seen my friend ' s face so grim or his <unk> 
so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation . we had walked several times 
up and down the <unk> , neither miss <unk> nor myself <unk> to <unk> in upon his <unk> before he 
<unk> himself from his <unk> . " it is very <unk> , miss <unk> ," said he , " that 
you should absolutely follow my <unk> in every <unk> ." " i shall most certainly do so ." " the 
matter is too serious for any <unk> . your life may <unk> upon your <unk> ." " i <unk> you 
that i am in your hands ." " in the first <unk> , both my friend and i must <unk> 
the night in your room ." both miss <unk> and i <unk> at him in <unk> . " yes , 
it must be so . let me explain . i believe that that is the <unk> <unk> over there ?" 
" yes , that is the crown ." " very good . your windows would be visible from there ?" 
" certainly ." " you must <unk> yourself to your room , on <unk> of a <unk> , when your 
<unk> comes back . then when you hear him <unk> for the night , you must open the <unk> of 
your window , <unk> the <unk> , put your <unk> there as a signal to us , and then <unk> 
quietly with <unk> which you are likely to want into the room which you <unk> to <unk> . i have 
no doubt that , in <unk> of the <unk> , you could <unk> there for one night ." " oh 
, yes , easily ." " the rest you will leave in our hands ." " but what will you 
do ?" " we shall <unk> the night in your room , and we shall <unk> the cause of this 
<unk> which has <unk> you ." " i believe , mr . holmes , that you have already made up 
your mind ," said miss <unk> , <unk> her hand upon my companion ' s <unk> . " perhaps i 
have ." " then , for pity ' s <unk> , tell me what was the cause of my <unk> 
' s death ." " i should prefer to have <unk> <unk> before i speak ." " you can at 
least tell me whether my own thought is <unk> , and if she <unk> from some <unk> <unk> ." " 
no , i do not think so . i think that there was probably some more <unk> cause . and 
now , miss <unk> , we must leave you for if dr . <unk> returned and saw us our journey 
would be in <unk> . good - <unk> , and be brave , for if you will do what i 
have told you , you may rest <unk> that we shall soon drive away the <unk> that <unk> you ." 
sherlock holmes and i had no <unk> in <unk> a bedroom and sitting - room at the crown <unk> . 
they were on the upper floor , and from our window we could <unk> a view of the avenue <unk> 
, and of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> house . at dusk we saw dr . <unk> <unk> 
drive past , his <unk> form <unk> up beside the little figure of the <unk> who drove him . the 
boy had some <unk> <unk> in <unk> the heavy <unk> <unk> , and we heard the <unk> <unk> of the 
doctor ' s voice and saw the <unk> with which he <unk> his <unk> fists at him . the <unk> 
drove on , and a few minutes later we saw a <unk> light <unk> up among the <unk> as the 
<unk> was lit in one of the sitting - rooms . " do you know , watson ," said holmes 
as we sat together in the <unk> <unk> , " i have really some <unk> as to taking you to 
- night . there is a <unk> <unk> of <unk> ." " can i be of <unk> ?" " your 
<unk> might be <unk> ." " then i shall certainly come ." " it is very kind of you ." 
" you speak of <unk> . you have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me ." 
" no , but i fancy that i may have <unk> a little more . i imagine that you saw 
all that i did ." " i saw nothing remarkable save the bell - <unk> , and what purpose that 
could <unk> i confess is more than i can imagine ." " you saw the <unk> , too ?" " 
yes , but i do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening 
between two rooms . it was so small that a <unk> could hardly pass through ." " i knew that 
we should find a <unk> before ever we came to <unk> <unk> ." " my dear holmes !" " oh 
, yes , i did . you remember in her <unk> she said that her <unk> could <unk> dr . 
<unk> ' s cigar . now , of course that suggested at once that there must be a <unk> between 
the two rooms . it could only be a small one , or it would have been remarked upon at 
the <unk> ' s inquiry . i <unk> a <unk> ." " but what <unk> can there be in that 
?" " well , there is at least a <unk> <unk> of <unk> . a <unk> is made , a 
<unk> is <unk> , and a lady who <unk> in the <unk> <unk> . does not that <unk> you ?" 
" i <unk> as yet see any <unk> ." " did you observe anything very peculiar about that <unk> ?" 
" no ." " it was <unk> to the floor . did you ever see a <unk> <unk> like that 
before ?" " i <unk> say that i have ." " the lady could not <unk> her <unk> . it 
must always be in the same <unk> position to the <unk> and to the <unk> -- or so we may 
call it , since it was <unk> never <unk> for a bell - pull ." " holmes ," i cried 
, " i <unk> to see dimly what you are <unk> at . we are only just in time to 
<unk> some subtle and <unk> crime ." " subtle enough and <unk> enough . when a doctor does go <unk> 
he is the first of <unk> . he has <unk> and he has <unk> . <unk> and <unk> were among 
the heads of their profession . this man strikes even <unk> , but i think , watson , that we 
shall be able to <unk> <unk> still . but we shall have <unk> enough before the night is over ; 
for <unk> ' <unk> let us have a quiet <unk> and turn our <unk> for a few hours to something 
more <unk> ." about <unk> o ' clock the light among the <unk> was <unk> , and all was dark 
in the direction of the <unk> house . two hours passed slowly away , and then , suddenly , just 
at the <unk> of <unk> , a single <unk> light <unk> out right in front of us . " that 
is our signal ," said holmes , <unk> to his feet ; " it comes from the <unk> window ." 
as we passed out he <unk> a few <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> that we were <unk> on a 
late visit to an acquaintance , and that it was <unk> that we might <unk> the night there . a 
moment later we were out on the dark road , a <unk> wind <unk> in our <unk> , and one 
<unk> light <unk> in front of us through the <unk> to <unk> us on our <unk> <unk> . there was 
little <unk> in <unk> the <unk> , for <unk> <unk> <unk> in the old park wall . making our way 
among the <unk> , we reached the <unk> , <unk> it , and were about to enter through the window 
when out from a <unk> of <unk> <unk> there <unk> what seemed to be a <unk> and <unk> child , 
who threw itself upon the <unk> with <unk> limbs and then ran swiftly across the <unk> into the <unk> . 
" my god !" i whispered ; " did you see it ?" holmes was for the moment as startled 
as i . his hand <unk> like a <unk> upon my wrist in his agitation . then he broke into 
a <unk> <unk> and put his <unk> to my ear . " it is a nice <unk> ," he murmured 
. " that is the <unk> ." i had <unk> the strange <unk> which the doctor <unk> . there was 
a <unk> , too ; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment . i confess that 
i felt <unk> in my mind when , after following holmes ' example and slipping off my <unk> , i 
found myself inside the bedroom . my companion <unk> <unk> the <unk> , <unk> the <unk> <unk> the table , 
and <unk> his eyes round the room . all was as we had seen it in the <unk> . then 
<unk> up to me and making a <unk> of his hand , he whispered into my ear again so <unk> 
that it was all that i could do to <unk> the <unk> : " the least sound would be <unk> 
to our plans ." i <unk> to show that i had heard . " we must sit without light . 
he would see it through the <unk> ." i <unk> again . " do not go <unk> ; your very 
life may <unk> upon it . have your <unk> <unk> in case we should need it . i will sit 
on the side of the <unk> , and you in that chair ." i took out my <unk> and laid 
it on the corner of the table . holmes had brought up a long <unk> <unk> , and this he 
placed upon the <unk> beside him . by it he laid the box of <unk> and the <unk> of a 
<unk> . then he turned down the <unk> , and we were left in <unk> . how shall i ever 
<unk> that dreadful <unk> ? i could not hear a sound , not even the drawing of a <unk> , 
and yet i knew that my companion sat open - <unk> , within a few feet of me , in 
the same state of nervous <unk> in which i was myself . the <unk> <unk> off the least <unk> of 
light , and we waited in absolute <unk> . from outside came the <unk> cry of a night - <unk> 
, and once at our very window a long drawn <unk> <unk> , which told us that the <unk> was 
indeed at <unk> . far away we could hear the deep <unk> of the <unk> clock , which <unk> out 
every quarter of an hour . how long they seemed , those quarters ! twelve struck , and one and 
two and three , and still we sat waiting <unk> for whatever might <unk> . suddenly there was the <unk> 
gleam of a light up in the direction of the <unk> , which vanished immediately , but was <unk> by 
a strong <unk> of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . someone in the next room had lit a dark - 
<unk> . i heard a <unk> sound of <unk> , and then all was <unk> once more , though the 
<unk> <unk> <unk> . for half an hour i sat with <unk> <unk> . then suddenly another sound became <unk> 
-- a very <unk> , <unk> sound , like that of a small <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> from a 
<unk> . the instant that we heard it , holmes sprang from the <unk> , struck a <unk> , and 
<unk> <unk> with his <unk> at the bell - pull . " you see it , watson ?" he <unk> 
. " you see it ?" but i saw nothing . at the moment when holmes struck the light i 
heard a <unk> , clear <unk> , but the <unk> <unk> <unk> into my <unk> eyes made it <unk> for 
me to tell what it was at which my friend <unk> so savagely . i could , however , see 
that his face was <unk> <unk> and <unk> with <unk> and <unk> . he had ceased to <unk> and was 
<unk> up at the <unk> when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most <unk> cry to 
which i have ever listened . it <unk> up <unk> and <unk> , a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and fear 
and <unk> all <unk> in the one dreadful shriek . they say that away down in the <unk> , and 
even in the <unk> <unk> , that cry raised the <unk> from their <unk> . it struck cold to our 
<unk> , and i stood <unk> at holmes , and he at me , until the last <unk> of it 
had <unk> away into the silence from which it rose . " what can it mean ?" i <unk> . 
" it means that it is all over ," holmes answered . " and perhaps , after all , it 
is for the best . take your <unk> , and we will enter dr . <unk> ' s room ." 
with a <unk> face he lit the <unk> and led the way down the <unk> . twice he struck at 
the chamber door without any <unk> from within . then he turned the <unk> and entered , i at his 
heels , with the <unk> <unk> in my hand . it was a singular <unk> which <unk> our eyes . 
on the table stood a dark - <unk> with the shutter half open , throwing a <unk> <unk> of light 
upon the <unk> safe , the door of which was <unk> . beside this table , on the <unk> chair 
, sat dr . <unk> <unk> <unk> in a long <unk> <unk> - <unk> , his <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
, and his feet <unk> into red <unk> <unk> <unk> . across his <unk> lay the <unk> <unk> with the 
long <unk> which we had <unk> during the day . his chin was <unk> <unk> and his eyes were <unk> 
in a dreadful , <unk> <unk> at the corner of the <unk> . round his <unk> he had a peculiar 
<unk> band , with <unk> <unk> , which seemed to be bound <unk> round his head . as we entered 
he made neither sound nor motion . " the band ! the speckled band !" whispered holmes . i took 
a step forward . in an instant his strange <unk> began to <unk> , and there <unk> itself from among 
his <unk> the <unk> <unk> - shaped head and <unk> neck of a <unk> <unk> . " it is a 
<unk> <unk> !" cried holmes ; " the <unk> <unk> in <unk> . he has <unk> within ten <unk> of 
being <unk> . <unk> does , in <unk> , <unk> upon the <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> into the 
<unk> which he <unk> for another . let us <unk> this creature back into its <unk> , and we can 
then remove miss <unk> to some <unk> of <unk> and let the <unk> police know what has <unk> ." as 
he spoke he drew the <unk> - <unk> swiftly from the dead man ' s <unk> , and throwing the 
<unk> round the <unk> ' s neck he drew it from its <unk> perch and , <unk> it at arm 
' s length , threw it into the <unk> safe , which he <unk> upon it . such are the 
true facts of the death of dr . <unk> <unk> , of <unk> <unk> . it is not <unk> that 
i should <unk> a <unk> which has already run to too great a length by <unk> how we broke the 
<unk> news to the <unk> girl , how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her 
good <unk> at <unk> , of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor 
<unk> his <unk> while <unk> playing with a <unk> <unk> . the little which i had yet to <unk> of 
the case was told me by sherlock holmes as we travelled back next day . " i had ," said 
he , " come to an entirely <unk> conclusion which <unk> , my dear watson , how <unk> it always 
is to reason from <unk> data . the <unk> of the <unk> , and the use of the word ' 
band ,' which was <unk> by the poor girl , no doubt , to explain the appearance which she had 
caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her <unk> , were sufficient to put me upon an entirely 
<unk> scent . i can only <unk> the <unk> that i <unk> <unk> my position when , however , it 
became clear to me that whatever <unk> <unk> an occupant of the room could not come either from the window 
or the door . my attention was <unk> drawn , as i have already remarked to you , to this 
<unk> , and to the bell - <unk> which <unk> down to the <unk> . the <unk> that this was 
a <unk> , and that the <unk> was <unk> to the floor , <unk> gave rise to the suspicion that 
the <unk> was there as a <unk> for something passing through the <unk> and coming to the <unk> . the 
<unk> of a <unk> <unk> <unk> to me , and when i <unk> it with my <unk> that the doctor 
was furnished with a <unk> of <unk> from <unk> , i felt that i was probably on the right <unk> 
. the <unk> of <unk> a form of <unk> which could not <unk> be <unk> by any <unk> <unk> was 
just such a one as would occur to a <unk> and <unk> man who had had an <unk> <unk> . 
the <unk> with which such a <unk> would take <unk> would also , from his point of view , be 
an advantage . it would be a sharp - <unk> <unk> , indeed , who could <unk> the two little 
dark <unk> which would show where the <unk> <unk> had done their work . then i thought of the <unk> 
. of course he must <unk> the <unk> before the morning light <unk> it to the <unk> . he had 
trained it , probably by the use of the <unk> which we saw , to return to him when <unk>
